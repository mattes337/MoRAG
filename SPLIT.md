### ðŸ”„ REMAINING TASKS

#### Task 36: Complete Cleanup and Migration (PARTIALLY_COMPLETE)
- **Issue**: Legacy code still exists in `src/morag/`
- **Status**: Modular packages are complete but cleanup needed
- **Actions Required**:
  - Remove obsolete code from `src/morag/processors/`
  - Remove obsolete code from `src/morag/converters/`
  - Remove obsolete code from `src/morag/services/`
  - Update all import paths to use package imports
  - Update examples and scripts

#### Task 37: Repository Structure Optimization (NEW)
- **Issue**: Need unified development guidelines and architecture documentation
- **Status**: Specification created, implementation needed
- **Actions Required**:
  - Create comprehensive architecture documentation
  - Implement integration tests for modular architecture
  - Standardize package documentation
  - Create development guidelines

## Dependency Management âœ…

Each package has its own `pyproject.toml` file with clearly defined dependencies:

1. **morag-core**: No dependencies on other MoRAG packages
2. **Processor Packages**: Depend on `morag-core` and `morag-services`
3. **morag-services**: Depends on `morag-core`
4. **morag**: Depends on all other packages (integration layer)

## Cross-Package Communication âœ…

Communication between packages is implemented through the interfaces defined in `morag-core`. This ensures loose coupling between packages and allows for easier testing and maintenance.

## Migration Strategy âœ…

The migration has been completed successfully with all packages implemented and tested. The modular architecture is now the primary structure.

## Next Steps (Remaining Tasks)

1. **Task 36: Complete Cleanup** - Remove legacy code from `src/morag/`
2. **Task 37: Repository Optimization** - Standardize documentation and development guidelines
3. **Task 19: n8n Workflows** - Create workflow automation templates
4. **Task 23: LLM Provider Abstraction** - Implement multi-provider support

## Architecture Benefits

The modular architecture provides several key benefits:

- **Isolated Dependencies**: Each converter has its own package and container, eliminating dependency conflicts
- **Scalability**: Scale individual converters based on demand (e.g., more document workers, fewer video workers)
- **Resource Optimization**: Allocate resources appropriately per converter type
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Update converters independently without affecting the entire system
- **Resilience**: If one converter fails, others continue working
- **Microservices Ready**: Each package can be deployed as a separate microservice
