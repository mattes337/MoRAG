# MoRAG Context Generation Testing System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive context generation testing system for MoRAG that uses agentic AI to find entities, navigate through the knowledge graph, and execute prompts with generated context.

## System Architecture

The context generation testing system consists of several key components:

### 1. AgenticContextGenerator
The main class that orchestrates the entire context generation process:
- **Entity Extraction**: Uses LLM-based reasoning to extract relevant entities from prompts
- **Graph Navigation**: Intelligently traverses the knowledge graph to find related information
- **Vector Search**: Searches document collections for relevant content
- **Context Scoring**: Evaluates the quality and relevance of generated context
- **Response Generation**: Synthesizes all information into a comprehensive response

### 2. ContextGenerationResult
A data structure that captures all aspects of the context generation process:
- Input prompt and timestamp
- Extracted entities with types and relevance scores
- Graph entities and relationships found
- Vector search results
- Reasoning paths identified
- Context quality score
- Final LLM response
- Processing steps and performance metrics

## Key Features

### Agentic AI Approach
- **Intelligent Entity Extraction**: Uses LLM reasoning to identify 3-7 most relevant entities
- **Adaptive Graph Traversal**: Navigates the knowledge graph based on entity relationships
- **Quality-Aware Processing**: Continuously evaluates and scores context quality
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Combines graph knowledge, vector search, and reasoning

### Comprehensive Context Generation
1. **Entity Analysis**: Extracts and normalizes entities with confidence scores
2. **Graph Exploration**: Finds related entities and relationships in Neo4j
3. **Document Retrieval**: Searches Qdrant for relevant document chunks
4. **Reasoning Path Analysis**: Uses LLM to identify important connection patterns
5. **Context Quality Scoring**: Evaluates relevance and completeness
6. **Response Synthesis**: Generates comprehensive answers using all context

### Robust Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when components are unavailable
- Fallback mechanisms for scoring and processing
- Detailed error reporting and logging
- Component isolation to prevent cascade failures

## Technical Implementation

### Entity Extraction Process
1. **LLM-Based Analysis**: Uses structured prompts to extract 3-7 key entities
2. **Type Classification**: Assigns semantic types (PERSON, CONCEPT, MEDICAL_CONDITION, etc.)
3. **Relevance Scoring**: Provides confidence scores and relevance explanations
4. **Entity Normalization**: Uses LLM-based normalization for consistent naming

### Graph Navigation Strategy
1. **Entity Matching**: Searches Neo4j for entities matching extracted names
2. **Relationship Discovery**: Finds connections and related entities
3. **Reasoning Path Analysis**: Uses LLM to identify important connection patterns
4. **Result Filtering**: Limits results to maintain performance while maximizing relevance

### Context Quality Scoring
- **LLM-Based Evaluation**: Uses structured prompts to assess context quality
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Considers relevance, completeness, and usefulness
- **Heuristic Fallback**: Provides scoring when LLM is unavailable
- **Continuous Improvement**: Scores guide further context gathering

## Performance Characteristics

### Scalability Features
- **Concurrent Processing**: Uses semaphores to limit concurrent LLM requests
