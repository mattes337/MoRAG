## Technical Implementation Notes

### Decision Tree Framework
```python
class DecisionNode:
    def __init__(self, id: str, instruction: str, options: dict):
        self.id = id
        self.instruction = instruction
        self.options = options
    
    async def decide(self, tree_data: TreeData, base_lm: LM, 
                    available_tools: list) -> Decision:
        # Context-aware decision making logic
        pass

class Tree:
    def __init__(self, branch_initialisation: str = "default"):
        self.decision_nodes = {}
        self.tools = {}
        
    def add_tool(self, tool, branch_id: str = None, **kwargs):
        # Dynamic tool registration
        pass
```

### Tool Registration System
```python
@tool(tree=tree)
async def custom_search(query: str, filters: dict) -> AsyncGenerator:
    # Custom tool implementation with streaming results
    yield Status("Searching...")
    results = await perform_search(query, filters)
    yield Result(results)
```

### Weaviate Integration
```python
class WeaviateProcessor:
    async def preprocess_collection(self, collection_name: str):
        # Collection analysis and optimization
        pass
    
    async def query_collection(self, query: str, collection: str):
        # Optimized Weaviate querying
        pass
```

## Conclusion

Elysia offers a fundamentally different approach to agentic RAG systems through its decision tree-based architecture and dynamic tool selection. While MoRAG excels in structured pipeline processing and multi-database support, integrating Elysia's decision-making paradigm could significantly enhance MoRAG's adaptability and intelligence.

The most impactful additions would be:
1. **Decision tree framework** for adaptive query processing
2. **Dynamic tool selection** for context-aware operations
3. **Enhanced Weaviate integration** for optimized vector operations

These enhancements would enable MoRAG to dynamically adapt its processing strategy based on query complexity, data availability, and user context, while maintaining its robust multi-modal processing capabilities and broad database support.

The integration would create a hybrid system that combines MoRAG's comprehensive content processing pipeline with Elysia's intelligent decision-making capabilities, resulting in a more adaptive and user-centric RAG system.
