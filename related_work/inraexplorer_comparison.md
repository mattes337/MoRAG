**Venue**: arXiv 2024
**Paper URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15501](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15501)
**Key Innovation**: Agentic workflow system with specialized tools for scientific research exploration

## Core Contributions

INRAExplorer focuses on:
1. **Specialized Tool Framework**: Pluggable tools for domain-specific tasks (IdentifyExperts, trend analysis)
2. **Dynamic Tool Composition**: Automatic tool selection and chaining based on query requirements
3. **Hybrid Search Integration**: Dense + sparse vector combination with multiple strategies
4. **Query Strategy Selection**: Automatic selection between different reasoning approaches

## Comparison with MoRAG

### Similarities

| Feature | Both Systems |
|---------|-------------|
| **Agentic Architecture** | Multi-agent systems with specialized roles |
| **Semantic Search** | Vector-based similarity search |
| **Domain Flexibility** | Adaptable to different domains |
| **Performance Optimization** | Caching and query optimization |

### Key Differences

#### 1. Tool Specialization Framework
- **INRAExplorer**: Pluggable tools with specialized functions (IdentifyExperts, trend analysis, etc.)
- **MoRAG**: General-purpose agents without systematic tool specialization framework
- **Gap**: MoRAG lacks structured approach to domain-specific tool development

#### 2. Query Strategy Selection
- **INRAExplorer**: Automatic selection between different reasoning strategies based on query type
- **MoRAG**: Single approach (recursive fact retrieval) for all queries
- **Impact**: Optimized performance through query-appropriate strategy selection

#### 3. Hybrid Search Implementation
- **INRAExplorer**: Dense + sparse vector fusion with BM25/keyword search
- **MoRAG**: Vector + graph combination but no sparse (BM25) integration
- **Gap**: Missing lexical matching capabilities in MoRAG

#### 4. Dynamic Tool Composition
- **INRAExplorer**: Runtime tool selection and chaining based on query analysis
- **MoRAG**: Fixed agent workflows without dynamic composition
- **Gap**: Less flexible task execution in MoRAG
