# Advanced LangGraph Multi‑Agent Pipeline (Marktechpost) — Implications for MoRAG

Source: https://github.com/Marktechpost/AI-Tutorial-Codes-Included/blob/main/advanced_langgraph_multi_agent_pipeline_Marktechpost.ipynb

## Summary
Notebook builds a multi‑agent workflow using LangGraph: planner, researcher, tool‑using agents, memory/state passing, and control edges. Focus is on modular graph orchestration and tool calling (web search, RAG) with explicit state machine and interruptible steps.

## Key Ideas
- Graph‑structured agent orchestration with typed state and control flow (branches, loops).
- Planner → Decomposer → Workers pattern; toolformer‑style actions; guardrails per edge.
- Shared memory/state object; persistence across steps; human‑in‑the‑loop interrupts.
- Observability: step logs, state snapshots, retry policies per node.

## Comparison to MoRAG
MoRAG already uses modular service orchestration and recursive retrieval. Opportunities:
- Formalize an execution graph for ingestion and intelligent retrieval (processing vs ingest modes) using explicit state machines.
- Add planner/decomposer agents to split complex questions into entity‑centric subgoals and graph traversal plans.
- Standardize step‑level retries/timeouts and state snapshots for resume capability (requested by user).

## Implementation Sketch
- Define a RetrievalGraph: nodes = entity_extraction, entity_match, neighborhood_expand, chunk_load, fact_extract, score, recurse, synthesize.
- Typed State: includes query, target language, entity list, hop budget, visited set, accumulated facts, citations.
- Controller: decides next node based on state (factsOnly, skip‑fact‑evaluation flags, score thresholds, hop limits).
- Interrupt hooks: expose REST endpoint to inspect/alter state mid‑run.

## Testing
- Unit: each node pure function with mocked services.
- Integration: golden queries that require multi‑hop; verify state evolution and outputs (facts with machine‑readable sources).
- Resumability: simulate crash and resume from last snapshot.

## Fit with MoRAG
- Aligns with user’s requirement for recursive, LLM‑guided path following with explicit decisions.
- Can reuse existing services; add a thin orchestrator package (no legacy/back‑compat needed).

## Takeaways we can adapt in MoRAG
- Introduce an explicit LangGraph‑like state machine for intelligent retrieval
- Add planner/decomposer step before traversal; encode subgoals as entities/relations
- Implement per‑node retries/timeouts and state snapshots for resume
- Provide human‑in‑the‑loop interrupts via REST to inspect/update state
- Log stepwise state for observability; store minimal state JSON per step for debugging



## Detailed Orchestration Design for MoRAG
- Represent retrieval as a directed graph of nodes with typed inputs/outputs and an explicit controller.
- Persist a compact State at each transition to enable resume and human-in-the-loop.

### State Model (Pydantic)
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Dict, Set, Optional

class RetrievalState(BaseModel):
    query: str
    language: Optional[str] = None
    hop_budget: int = 3
    visited_entities: Set[str] = set()
    frontier_entities: List[str] = []
    accumulated_facts: List[dict] = []  # include source tags
    citations: List[str] = []  # [filename:chunk:topic]
    flags: Dict[str, bool] = {"factsOnly": False, "skip_fact_evaluation": False}
    last_node: Optional[str] = None
    step: int = 0
```

### Node Contracts
```python
from typing import Protocol

class Node(Protocol):
    name: str
    async def run(self, state: RetrievalState) -> RetrievalState: ...

class Controller:
    def __init__(self, nodes: Dict[str, Node]):
        self.nodes = nodes
    async def next(self, state: RetrievalState) -> str:
        # simple policy example
        if not state.frontier_entities:
            return "entity_extraction"
        if state.hop_budget <= 0:
            return "synthesize"
        return "expand"
```

### Execution Loop (Pseudocode)
```python
async def execute(graph: Dict[str, Node], ctrl: Controller, state: RetrievalState, store):
    while True:
        node_name = await ctrl.next(state)
        node = graph[node_name]
        state.last_node = node_name
        state.step += 1
        store.save_snapshot(state)
        state = await node.run(state)
        if node_name == "synthesize":
            return state
```

### Concrete Nodes (Sketch)
```python
class EntityExtraction(Node):
    name = "entity_extraction"
    async def run(self, state):
        ents = await llm_extract_entities(state.query)
        state.frontier_entities = dedup_and_normalize(ents)
        return state

class Expand(Node):
    name = "expand"
    async def run(self, state):
        e = state.frontier_entities.pop(0)
        nbrs = await graph_store.neighbors(e, depth=1)
        state.visited_entities.add(e)
        state.frontier_entities.extend([n for n in nbrs if n not in state.visited_entities])
        state.hop_budget -= 1
        return state

class LoadChunks(Node):
    name = "load_chunks"
    async def run(self, state):
        chunks = await vector_store.search_entities(state.frontier_entities)
        state.citations.extend([c.tag for c in chunks])
        state.accumulated_facts.extend(await llm_extract_facts(chunks))
        return state

class Synthesize(Node):
    name = "synthesize"
    async def run(self, state):
        if state.flags.get("factsOnly"):
            return state
        state.answer = await llm_synthesize(state.query, state.accumulated_facts)
        return state
```

## REST Interrupts and Observability
- GET /retrieval/{id}/state → current snapshot
- POST /retrieval/{id}/state → patch flags/frontier/hop_budget
- Logs per step: node name, duration, decisions, deltas in state

## Retry/Timeout Policies
- Per-node config: max_retries, timeout_s, jittered backoff.
- Controller escalates after repeated failures (e.g., reduce hop_budget, change tool choice).

## Tests
```python
async def test_resume_from_snapshot(tmp_path):
    store = FileSnapshotStore(tmp_path)
    state = RetrievalState(query="...", hop_budget=2)
    # run one step
    state1 = await graph["entity_extraction"].run(state)
    store.save_snapshot(state1)
    # simulate crash and resume
    resumed = store.load_latest()
    assert resumed.step == state1.step
```
