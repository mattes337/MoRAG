**Key Innovation**: Graph-based RAG with hierarchical community detection for global sensemaking queries

## Core Contributions

GraphRAG introduces:
1. **Hierarchical Community Detection**: Uses Leiden algorithm to partition graphs into hierarchical communities
2. **Community-Based Summarization**: Multi-level summarization of graph communities (C0-C3)
3. **Global vs Local Query Distinction**: Different approaches for sensemaking vs specific fact retrieval
4. **Map-Reduce Summarization**: Aggregation over community summaries with relevance scoring

## Comparison with MoRAG

### Similarities

### Key Differences

#### 1. Graph Organization
- **GraphRAG**: Hierarchical community detection with Leiden algorithm (C0-C3 levels)
- **MoRAG**: Flat graph structure without community organization
- **Impact**: GraphRAG enables global sensemaking queries requiring corpus-wide understanding

#### 2. Query Classification
- **GraphRAG**: Distinguishes between local (specific facts) and global (sensemaking) queries
- **MoRAG**: Single recursive fact retrieval approach for all query types
- **Impact**: 72-83% win rate on comprehensiveness, 62-82% on diversity for global queries

#### 3. Summarization Strategy
- **GraphRAG**: Map-reduce over community summaries with hierarchical aggregation
- **MoRAG**: Operates on individual facts/chunks without community-level abstraction
- **Gap**: Missing corpus-level understanding and global summarization

#### 4. Evaluation Framework
- **GraphRAG**: LLM-generated personas and tasks for corpus-specific evaluation
- **MoRAG**: No systematic evaluation or benchmarking framework
- **Gap**: Lack of quality assessment for different query types

## Conclusion

GraphRAG offers transformative capabilities for handling global sensemaking queries that require corpus-wide understanding. While MoRAG excels in multi-modal processing and sophisticated entity handling, integrating GraphRAG's hierarchical community detection and global query handling could significantly expand MoRAG's capabilities.

The most impactful additions would be:
1. **Hierarchical community detection** for graph organization
2. **Community-based summarization** for global understanding
3. **Global query classification** for optimized handling

These enhancements would enable MoRAG to handle complex, corpus-wide queries that require understanding relationships and themes across the entire knowledge base, significantly expanding its analytical capabilities.
