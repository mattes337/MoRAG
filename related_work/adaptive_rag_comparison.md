# Adaptive RAG (LangGraph) vs MoRAG: Comparative Analysis

## Approach Overview

**Source**: LangGraph Adaptive RAG Implementation by Piyush Agnihotri
**Repository**: [https://github.com/piyushagni5/langgraph-adaptive-rag](https://github.com/piyushagni5/langgraph-adaptive-rag)
**Key Innovation**: State machine-based adaptive RAG with systematic quality control and self-correction loops
**Architecture**: Binary decision-making with explicit self-correction mechanisms

## Core Components

The LangGraph Adaptive RAG implements:
1. **Query Router**: Binary routing decision (vectorstore vs websearch)
2. **Document Relevance Grader**: Binary relevance assessment for retrieved documents
3. **Hallucination Detector**: Binary grounding assessment for generated responses
4. **Answer Quality Grader**: Binary quality assessment for final answers
5. **Self-Correction Loop**: Built-in retry mechanism with clear exit conditions

## Comparison with MoRAG

### Similarities

| Feature | Both Systems |
|---------|-------------|
| **Quality Assessment** | Response quality evaluation mechanisms |
| **Iterative Refinement** | Context analysis and improvement capabilities |
| **Multi-source Retrieval** | Multiple retrieval strategies and sources |
| **Modular Architecture** | Component-based system design |

### Key Differences

#### 1. Decision Making Approach
- **Adaptive RAG**: Binary decisions (yes/no) at each step for simplicity
- **MoRAG**: Confidence scores and complex thresholds
- **Learning**: Binary decisions are easier to debug and reason about

#### 2. Self-Correction Integration
- **Adaptive RAG**: Built-in retry mechanism with clear exit conditions in main workflow
- **MoRAG**: Quality assessment exists but not integrated into main pipeline
- **Gap**: MoRAG lacks systematic retry loop for poor-quality responses

#### 3. Hallucination Detection
- **Adaptive RAG**: Dedicated hallucination grader as first-class citizen in workflow
- **MoRAG**: Quality assessment exists but not specifically focused on hallucination detection
- **Gap**: Missing explicit hallucination detection in main pipeline

#### 4. Web Search Integration
- **Adaptive RAG**: Automatic fallback to web search when local retrieval fails
- **MoRAG**: No web search integration
- **Gap**: Missing external knowledge source fallback

#### 5. State Management
- **Adaptive RAG**: Simple state dictionary with clear state transitions
- **MoRAG**: Complex context objects and multiple data structures
- **Learning**: Simpler state management improves maintainability

        self.quality_pipeline = quality_pipeline
        self.web_search_tool = web_search_tool
        self.max_retries = 3

    async def process_with_correction(self, query: str) -> CorrectedResponse:
        for attempt in range(self.max_retries):
            response = await self.morag_pipeline.process_query(query)
            validation = await self.quality_pipeline.validate_response(
                query, response.source_documents, response.answer
            )
            
            if validation.overall_quality >= 0.8:
                return CorrectedResponse(
                    answer=response.answer,
                    sources=response.source_documents,
                    attempts=attempt + 1,
                    quality_score=validation.overall_quality
                )
            
            # Apply correction strategies based on failure type
            if not validation.is_grounded:
                web_docs = await self._web_search(query)
                response = await self._regenerate_with_web_docs(query, web_docs)
                continue
```

### Quality Control Pipeline
```python
class QualityControlPipeline:
    def __init__(self, llm_client):
        self.document_grader = DocumentRelevanceGrader(llm_client)
        self.hallucination_detector = HallucinationDetector(llm_client)
        self.answer_grader = AnswerQualityGrader(llm_client)

    async def validate_response(self, query: str, documents: List[str], response: str) -> ValidationResult:
        # Binary assessments for clear decision making
        doc_relevance = await self.document_grader.grade_documents(query, documents)
        is_grounded = await self.hallucination_detector.check_grounding(response, documents)
        answers_query = await self.answer_grader.assess_quality(query, response)
        
        return ValidationResult(
            document_relevance=doc_relevance,
            is_grounded=is_grounded,
            answers_query=answers_query,
            overall_quality=self._calculate_overall_quality(doc_relevance, is_grounded, answers_query)

```

## Conclusion

The LangGraph Adaptive RAG approach offers valuable lessons in simplicity, systematic quality control, and self-correction mechanisms. While MoRAG has more sophisticated entity processing and knowledge graph integration, adopting Adaptive RAG's quality control patterns could significantly improve MoRAG's reliability and maintainability.

The most impactful additions would be:
1. **Systematic self-correction loops** for improved reliability
2. **Explicit hallucination detection** for better factual accuracy
3. **Web search fallback** for enhanced coverage
4. **Binary decision framework** for improved debugging

These enhancements would make MoRAG more robust and reliable while preserving its advanced semantic and graph-based capabilities. The key is to integrate these quality control mechanisms into MoRAG's existing sophisticated architecture rather than replacing it.
