**Authors**: Aditi Singh, Abul Ehtesham, Saket Kumar, Tala Talaei Khoei
**Venue**: arXiv 2025
**Paper URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00734](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00734)
**Key Innovation**: Comprehensive survey of agentic RAG systems with taxonomy of architectures and workflow patterns

## Core Contributions

The survey identifies key agentic patterns:
1. **Agentic Design Patterns**: Reflection, planning, tool use, multi-agent collaboration

#### 2. Adaptive Strategy Selection
- **Survey**: Dynamic strategy selection based on query complexity analysis
- **MoRAG**: Single recursive fact retrieval approach for all query types
- **Impact**: Optimized performance through query-appropriate strategy selection

#### 3. Corrective RAG Mechanisms
- **Survey**: Self-correction capabilities with iterative refinement and quality assessment
- **MoRAG**: Has reflection but no systematic correction mechanisms
- **Gap**: Missing systematic error correction and quality validation

#### 4. Hierarchical Agent Architecture
- **Survey**: Multi-level agent hierarchies for complex task decomposition
- **MoRAG**: Flat agent structure without hierarchical organization
- **Gap**: Limited scalability for complex multi-step tasks

        # 1. Orchestrator analyzes task complexity
        # 2. Decomposes into subtasks
        # 3. Assigns workers to specialized subtasks
        # 4. Coordinates worker outputs
        # 5. Synthesizes final result
        pass

        # 1. Assess response quality and relevance
        # 2. Identify potential errors or gaps
        # 3. Retrieve additional information if needed
        # 4. Generate corrected response
        # 5. Validate correction quality
        pass
```

    async def select_strategy(self, query: str) -> RetrievalStrategy:
        # 1. Analyze query complexity
        # 2. Determine required reasoning type
        # 3. Assess domain specificity
        # 4. Select appropriate agent workflow pattern

## Conclusion

The Agentic RAG Survey provides a comprehensive framework for enhancing MoRAG's agent coordination and self-correction capabilities. While MoRAG has sophisticated knowledge graph integration and multi-modal processing, adopting systematic agentic workflow patterns could significantly improve its reliability, efficiency, and ability to handle complex tasks.

The most impactful additions would be:
1. **Orchestrator-worker patterns** for systematic task coordination
2. **Corrective RAG mechanisms** for improved reliability
3. **Adaptive strategy selection** for optimized performance

These enhancements would make MoRAG more robust, reliable, and capable of handling complex multi-step reasoning tasks while maintaining its advanced semantic and graph-based capabilities.
