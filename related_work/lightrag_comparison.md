**Key Innovation**: Graph-based text indexing with dual-level retrieval paradigm for comprehensive and efficient RAG

## Core Contributions

LightRAG introduces:
1. **Dual-level Retrieval**: Systematic distinction between specific (entity-focused) and abstract (theme-focused) queries

## Comparison with MoRAG

### Similarities

| Feature | Both Systems |
|---------|-------------|
| **Graph-based Text Indexing** | LLM-based entity/relation extraction |
| **Multi-hop Subgraph Expansion** | Neighboring node collection for comprehensive context |
| **Incremental Graph Updates** | Fast adaptation without full index rebuilding |
| **Vector-Graph Integration** | Combination of vector search with graph structure |

### Key Differences

#### 1. Dual-level Retrieval Paradigm
- **LightRAG**: Systematic distinction between specific (entity-focused) and abstract (theme-focused) queries with different retrieval strategies
- **MoRAG**: Single recursive fact retrieval approach for all query types
- **Gap**: Missing query-type-specific retrieval optimization

#### 2. Key-Value Profiling System
- **LightRAG**: LLM-generated text summaries for each entity and relation, stored as retrievable key-value pairs
- **MoRAG**: Direct entity/relation storage without profiling or summarization
- **Gap**: Missing pre-processed, contextually relevant summaries

#### 3. Vector-Graph Integration Approach
- **LightRAG**: Keyword extraction → vector matching → graph expansion → neighboring node collection
- **MoRAG**: Separate vector search and graph traversal without unified keyword-driven approach
- **Gap**: Less systematic integration of vector and graph retrieval

#### 4. Systematic Deduplication
- **LightRAG**: Automatic identification and merging of identical entities/relations across document chunks
- **MoRAG**: Basic entity normalization but no cross-chunk deduplication optimization
- **Gap**: Missing systematic deduplication for graph efficiency
