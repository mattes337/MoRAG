### [00:00:00] Introduction and Welcome

**SPEAKER_00**: Hey everyone, welcome back to AI Learning Hub! I'm Alex, and today we're going to build our very first neural network from scratch. This tutorial is perfect for beginners who want to understand how neural networks actually work under the hood.

By the end of this video, you'll have a working neural network that can classify handwritten digits, and more importantly, you'll understand every line of code we write. So grab your favorite beverage, fire up your code editor, and let's dive in!

### [00:01:15] What We'll Build Today

**SPEAKER_00**: Before we start coding, let me show you what we're going to build. We'll create a neural network that can look at images of handwritten digits and tell us which number it represents - 0 through 9.

*[Screen shows examples of handwritten digit images]*

This might seem simple, but it's actually the "Hello World" of machine learning. The same principles we'll learn today are used in much more complex applications like:
- Image recognition in self-driving cars
- Medical diagnosis from X-rays and MRIs
- Natural language processing for chatbots
- Recommendation systems on streaming platforms

### [00:02:45] Neural Network Fundamentals

**SPEAKER_00**: Let's start with the basics. What exactly is a neural network?

Think of it as a simplified model of how our brain processes information. Just like our brain has neurons that connect and communicate, artificial neural networks have nodes (or neurons) organized in layers.

*[Animation shows neural network structure]*

A basic neural network has three types of layers:
1. **Input Layer**: Receives the raw data (in our case, pixel values from digit images)
2. **Hidden Layers**: Process the information through mathematical operations
3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction (which digit it thinks it sees)

Each connection between neurons has a "weight" - a number that determines how much influence one neuron has on another. Training a neural network is essentially about finding the right weights.

### [00:05:20] Setting Up Our Development Environment

**SPEAKER_00**: Alright, let's get our hands dirty with some code! First, we need to set up our development environment.

You'll need Python installed on your computer. I recommend using Python 3.8 or newer. We'll also need a few libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```

Let me explain what each library does:
- **TensorFlow**: Our main deep learning framework
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array operations
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations and plots
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: For additional machine learning utilities

*[Screen shows installation process]*

If you're using Google Colab, most of these are already installed, which makes it perfect for beginners.

### [00:07:30] Loading and Exploring Our Dataset

**SPEAKER_00**: Now let's load our dataset. We'll use the famous MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the MNIST dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

print(f"Training data shape: {x_train.shape}")
print(f"Training labels shape: {y_train.shape}")
print(f"Test data shape: {x_test.shape}")
print(f"Test labels shape: {y_test.shape}")
```

*[Output shows data shapes]*

Let's break this down:
- We have 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images
- Each image is 28x28 pixels
- The labels are numbers from 0 to 9

Let's visualize a few examples:

```python
# Display first 10 training images
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
for i in range(10):
    plt.subplot(2, 5, i + 1)
    plt.imshow(x_train[i], cmap='gray')
    plt.title(f'Label: {y_train[i]}')
    plt.axis('off')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

*[Screen shows grid of handwritten digit images]*

### [00:10:15] Data Preprocessing

**SPEAKER_00**: Before we can train our neural network, we need to preprocess our data. This involves two main steps:

#### Step 1: Normalize the Pixel Values

```python
# Normalize pixel values to range [0, 1]
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.0
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.0

print(f"Min pixel value: {x_train.min()}")
print(f"Max pixel value: {x_train.max()}")
```

Why do we do this? Neural networks work better when input values are in a small, consistent range. Pixel values originally range from 0 to 255, so we divide by 255 to get values between 0 and 1.

#### Step 2: Reshape the Data

```python
# Reshape from 28x28 images to 784-dimensional vectors
x_train_flat = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], -1)
x_test_flat = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], -1)

print(f"Reshaped training data: {x_train_flat.shape}")
print(f"Reshaped test data: {x_test_flat.shape}")
```

We're flattening each 28x28 image into a single vector of 784 values. This is because our neural network expects a 1D input.

### [00:13:40] Building Our Neural Network

**SPEAKER_00**: Now for the exciting part - building our neural network! We'll use TensorFlow's Keras API, which makes this surprisingly simple:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Create the model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Display model architecture
model.summary()
```

*[Screen shows model summary]*

Let me explain each layer:

1. **First Hidden Layer**: 128 neurons with ReLU activation
   - Takes 784 inputs (our flattened image)
   - ReLU activation helps the network learn complex patterns

2. **Second Hidden Layer**: 64 neurons with ReLU activation
   - Processes information from the first layer
   - Gradually reduces the number of neurons

3. **Output Layer**: 10 neurons with softmax activation
   - One neuron for each digit (0-9)
   - Softmax gives us probabilities that sum to 1

### [00:16:25] Compiling the Model

**SPEAKER_00**: Before we can train our model, we need to compile it. This means specifying how the model should learn:

```python
model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
```

Let me explain these choices:

- **Optimizer (Adam)**: Controls how the model updates its weights during training. Adam is a popular choice because it's efficient and works well in most cases.

- **Loss Function**: Measures how wrong our predictions are. Sparse categorical crossentropy is perfect for classification problems like ours.

- **Metrics**: We'll track accuracy to see what percentage of predictions are correct.

### [00:18:10] Training the Neural Network

**SPEAKER_00**: Now comes the moment of truth - training our neural network!

```python
# Train the model
history = model.fit(
    x_train_flat, y_train,
    epochs=10,
    batch_size=32,
    validation_split=0.2,
    verbose=1
)
```

*[Screen shows training progress]*

Let's understand these parameters:

- **Epochs**: How many times the model sees the entire training dataset
- **Batch Size**: How many examples the model processes at once
- **Validation Split**: Reserves 20% of training data for validation

Watch the accuracy improve with each epoch! This is the neural network learning to recognize patterns in the handwritten digits.

### [00:21:30] Visualizing Training Progress

**SPEAKER_00**: Let's create some plots to visualize how our model learned:

```python
# Plot training history
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.title('Model Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')
plt.title('Model Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

*[Screen shows training curves]*

These plots tell us a lot:
- Accuracy increases over time (good!)
- Loss decreases over time (also good!)
- Training and validation curves are close (no overfitting)

### [00:24:15] Evaluating Model Performance

**SPEAKER_00**: Let's see how well our model performs on the test data:

```python
# Evaluate on test data
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test_flat, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy:.4f}")
print(f"Test Loss: {test_loss:.4f}")
```

*[Output shows test results]*

Wow! We achieved over 97% accuracy on the test set. That means our neural network correctly identifies handwritten digits 97 times out of 100!

### [00:25:45] Making Predictions

**SPEAKER_00**: Let's use our trained model to make predictions on some test images:

```python
# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(x_test_flat[:10])

# Display results
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))
for i in range(10):
    plt.subplot(2, 5, i + 1)
    plt.imshow(x_test[i], cmap='gray')
    
    predicted_digit = np.argmax(predictions[i])
    confidence = np.max(predictions[i])
    actual_digit = y_test[i]
    
    color = 'green' if predicted_digit == actual_digit else 'red'
    plt.title(f'Predicted: {predicted_digit}\nActual: {actual_digit}\nConfidence: {confidence:.2f}', 
              color=color)
    plt.axis('off')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

*[Screen shows prediction results]*

Look at that! Our neural network is making confident, accurate predictions. The confidence scores show how certain the model is about each prediction.

### [00:27:30] Understanding What the Model Learned

**SPEAKER_00**: Let's peek inside our neural network to see what it learned. We can visualize the weights of the first layer:

```python
# Get weights from first layer
weights = model.layers[0].get_weights()[0]

# Visualize some neurons
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 3))
for i in range(10):
    plt.subplot(1, 10, i + 1)
    # Reshape weight vector back to 28x28 image
    weight_image = weights[:, i].reshape(28, 28)
    plt.imshow(weight_image, cmap='RdBu')
    plt.title(f'Neuron {i}')
    plt.axis('off')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

*[Screen shows weight visualizations]*

These visualizations show what patterns each neuron in the first layer has learned to detect. Some look for edges, others for curves or specific shapes that are common in handwritten digits.
