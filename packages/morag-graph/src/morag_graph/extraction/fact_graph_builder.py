"""Build knowledge graphs from extracted facts.

REFACTORED: This module has been split for better maintainability.
The main functionality is now distributed across:
- graph_builder_interface.py: Main coordination and interface
- fact_graph_operations.py: Core operations and LLM interactions
- graph_utilities.py: Graph construction utilities

This file provides backward compatibility.
