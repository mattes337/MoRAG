"""Markdown conversion stage implementation.

REFACTORED: This module has been split for better maintainability.
The main functionality is now distributed across:
- markdown_conversion_stage.py: Main stage interface and coordination
- converter_factory.py: Converter selection logic
- conversion_processors.py: Individual converter implementations

This file provides backward compatibility.
