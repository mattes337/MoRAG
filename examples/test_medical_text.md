# Medical Research Notes

## Patient Case Study

Dr. Smith prescribed aspirin to treat the patient's headache. The medication was effective in reducing pain within 30 minutes. The patient reported no side effects during the treatment period.

## Research Findings

Recent studies show that vitamin D deficiency is linked to increased risk of respiratory infections. Patients with vitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL had 40% higher infection rates compared to those with adequate levels.

## Treatment Protocol

The new antibiotic protocol involves administering amoxicillin 500mg three times daily for 7 days. This treatment has shown 95% effectiveness in treating bacterial pneumonia cases.

## Clinical Observations

Blood pressure readings consistently showed hypertension in patients over 65 years old. The average systolic pressure was 145 mmHg, which is above the normal range of 120 mmHg.

## Drug Interactions

Warfarin interacts with vitamin K, potentially reducing its anticoagulant effects. Patients on warfarin therapy should monitor their vitamin K intake carefully.
