# Legacy Code Archive

## Purpose

These files are preserved for reference during the refactoring transition period.
They represent the original implementations that were replaced during the comprehensive
code refactoring effort to reduce maintenance debt and eliminate code duplication.

## Files Archived

- `*_original.py` - Original implementations before refactoring
- `*_with_old_code.py` - Intermediate versions with legacy code preserved

## Current Status

All backup files have been moved to this archive directory to:
- Reduce code duplication throughout the codebase
- Clarify which versions are canonical
- Maintain reference copies for comparison during transition

## Planned Removal

**These files will be permanently removed in version 1.0.0**

Once the refactored code has been thoroughly tested and validated in production,
these archived files will no longer be needed and will be deleted to completely
eliminate the maintenance debt.
