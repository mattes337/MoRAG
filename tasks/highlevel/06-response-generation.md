# Task 6: Final Response Generation System

## Overview

Implement the final response generation system that takes gathered facts and generates comprehensive responses with proper citations, timestamps, and source references.

## Current Status

- ✅ Basic LLM agents exist in `morag-core/ai/`
- ✅ Fact extraction provides structured data
- ✅ Citation tracking maintains source information
- ❌ Dedicated response generation agent missing
- ❌ Citation integration in responses incomplete
- ❌ Response quality assessment needs implementation

## Subtasks

### 6.1 Build Response Generation Agent

**File**: `packages/morag-reasoning/src/morag_reasoning/response_generator.py`

**Requirements**:
- Synthesize gathered facts into coherent responses
- Maintain logical flow and structure
- Support different response formats (detailed, summary, bullet points)
- Handle conflicting or incomplete information
- Provide reasoning transparency

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create LLM-based response generation agent
2. Implement fact synthesis algorithms
3. Add response structure templates
4. Create conflict resolution mechanisms
5. Add reasoning explanation features

**Expected Output**:
```python
class ResponseGenerator:
    async def generate_response(self, facts: List[CitedFact], query: str, 
                               format_options: ResponseFormat) -> GeneratedResponse:
        # Returns comprehensive response with reasoning
```

### 6.2 Implement Citation Integration

**File**: `packages/morag-reasoning/src/morag_reasoning/citation_integrator.py`

**Requirements**:
- Integrate citations seamlessly into response text
- Support multiple citation formats (academic, journalistic, web)
- Handle timestamp and chapter references
- Maintain citation accuracy and completeness
- Provide citation verification capabilities

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create citation integration framework
2. Implement multiple citation formats
3. Add timestamp and metadata integration
4. Create citation verification system
5. Add format customization options

**Expected Output**:
```python
class CitationIntegrator:
    async def integrate_citations(self, response: GeneratedResponse, 
                                 citation_format: CitationFormat) -> CitedResponse:
        # Returns response with properly formatted citations
```

### 6.3 Create Response Quality Assessment

**File**: `packages/morag-reasoning/src/morag_reasoning/response_assessor.py`

**Requirements**:
- Assess response completeness and accuracy
- Evaluate citation quality and coverage
- Check for logical consistency
- Measure response relevance to query
- Provide improvement suggestions

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create multi-dimensional quality assessment
2. Implement completeness and accuracy metrics
3. Add citation quality evaluation
4. Create consistency checking algorithms
5. Add improvement recommendation system

**Expected Output**:
```python
class ResponseQualityAssessor:
    async def assess_response(self, response: CitedResponse, 
                             original_query: str) -> QualityAssessment:
        # Returns comprehensive quality metrics and suggestions
```
