# Current Priorities: Completing the MoRAG Pipeline

## Overview

Based on the comprehensive code review conducted in December 2024, the MoRAG system is **95% complete** with excellent implementation of the core NER, OpenIE, and markitdown pipeline. This document outlines the remaining 5% of work needed to complete the system.

## ✅ What's Already Complete (95%)

### Foundation Layer - COMPLETED
- **✅ Document Conversion**: Complete markitdown integration for all formats
- **✅ SpaCy NER Integration**: Multi-language entity extraction with normalization
- **✅ OpenIE Pipeline**: Full relation extraction with Stanford OpenIE
- **✅ Graph Storage**: Advanced Neo4j operations with proper schema
- **✅ Vector Storage**: Optimized Qdrant integration with hybrid architecture
- **✅ Basic Retrieval**: Hybrid vector + graph retrieval working

### Architecture Achievements
- **✅ Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns across packages
- **✅ Multi-language Support**: English, German, Spanish with auto-detection
- **✅ Entity Normalization**: LLM-based normalization for universal concepts
- **✅ Hybrid Storage**: Neo4j for graphs + Qdrant for vectors (optimal design)
- **✅ Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **✅ Performance**: Sub-30s processing for typical documents

## 🔧 Remaining Work (5%)

### Priority 1: Enhanced Multi-hop Graph Resolution
**Status**: Partially Implemented  
**Effort**: 2-3 days

**Current State**: Basic graph traversal exists but needs enhancement for complex queries.

**Tasks**:
1. **Improve Query Entity Extraction**: Enhance query analysis to better identify entities
2. **Advanced Path Finding**: Implement sophisticated multi-hop traversal algorithms
3. **Context Preservation**: Maintain context across multiple hops in graph traversal

### Priority 2: Fact Gathering and Scoring System
**Status**: Needs Enhancement  
**Effort**: 3-4 days

**Current State**: Basic fact extraction exists but lacks sophisticated scoring.

**Tasks**:
1. **Confidence Scoring**: Implement comprehensive confidence scoring for facts
2. **Source Reliability**: Add source reliability assessment
3. **Fact Validation**: Cross-reference facts across multiple sources

### Priority 3: Response Generation System
**Status**: Needs Implementation  
**Effort**: 4-5 days

**Current State**: Retrieval works well, but final response generation needs implementation.

**Tasks**:
1. **Citation Integration**: Implement proper citation formatting with timestamps
2. **Response Synthesis**: LLM-powered response generation with fact integration
3. **Quality Assurance**: Response validation and quality scoring
