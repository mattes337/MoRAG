# MoRAG High-Level Implementation Tasks

This directory contains the comprehensive task breakdown for implementing the complete MoRAG (Modular Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline as outlined in the high-level overview.

## Overview

The MoRAG system implements a three-stage pipeline:

1. **Ingest Sources** → Convert, extract entities/relations, build knowledge graph
2. **Resolve Entities/Relations** → Multi-hop graph traversal, fact gathering
3. **Generate Response** → LLM-powered synthesis with citations

## Architecture Principles

### Entity Design
- **Generic Entities**: No positional/content context, only universal concepts
- **Normalized Forms**: Singular, non-conjugated (e.g., 'brain'/'brains' → 'brain')
- **Multi-language Support**: LLM-based normalization for Spanish, German, etc.

### Relation Design
- **Context Carriers**: Relations contain all contextual information
- **Multiple Relations**: Same entity pairs can have multiple relation types
- **Source Tracking**: Each relation links to specific DocumentChunk

### Graph Schema
```
Document → CONTAINS → DocumentChunk → MENTIONS → Entity
Entity ← SUBJECT/OBJECT ← Relation → OBJECT/SUBJECT → Entity
Relation → EXTRACTED_FROM → DocumentChunk
```

## Key Components

### 1. Ingestion Pipeline
- **Input**: Any source (document, audio, video, web)
- **Process**: markitdown → SpaCy NER → OpenIE → embeddings → Neo4j
- **Output**: Knowledge graph with entities, relations, and source tracking

### 2. Resolution Pipeline
- **Input**: User query
- **Process**: Entity extraction → multi-hop traversal → fact gathering → scoring
- **Output**: Ranked facts with citations and confidence scores

### 3. Response Generation
- **Input**: Gathered facts with sources
- **Process**: LLM synthesis with citation integration
- **Output**: Comprehensive response with timestamps, references, and sources

## Getting Started

1. **Review Current Implementation**: Examine existing codebase in `packages/morag-graph/`
2. **Choose Starting Point**: Recommend beginning with SpaCy NER integration
3. **Follow Task Files**: Each numbered file contains detailed implementation steps
4. **Test Incrementally**: Use existing test framework for validation
5. **Document Progress**: Update task completion status

## Dependencies

### External
- SpaCy (with language models: en_core_web_lg, de_core_news_lg, es_core_news_lg)
- Neo4j (>=5.15.0)
- Qdrant vector database
- Google Gemini API for LLM operations

### Internal
- morag-core: Base models and interfaces
- morag-graph: Graph operations and storage
- morag-services: Service layer and pipeline
- morag-reasoning: LLM agents and fact extraction

## Notes

- All tasks are designed to work with the existing modular architecture
- Intermediate file generation is crucial for debugging and pipeline continuation
- LLM-based normalization is preferred over static patterns for multi-language support
- The system should avoid static/magic terms, letting LLM handle domain capture
