# MoRAG High-Level Implementation Tasks

This directory contains the comprehensive task breakdown for implementing the complete MoRAG (Modular Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline as outlined in the high-level overview.

## Overview

The MoRAG system implements a three-stage pipeline:

1. **Ingest Sources** → Convert, extract entities/relations, build knowledge graph
2. **Resolve Entities/Relations** → Multi-hop graph traversal, fact gathering
3. **Generate Response** → LLM-powered synthesis with citations

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Already Implemented (80%)

- **Document Conversion**: Complete markitdown integration for all content types
- **Basic Entity/Relation Extraction**: LLM-based extraction with partial SpaCy integration
- **Graph Storage**: Full Neo4j implementation with proper Document/DocumentChunk schema
- **Vector Storage**: Qdrant integration for embeddings
- **Basic Query Resolution**: Hybrid retrieval and graph traversal operations
- **Intermediate Files**: System for debugging and pipeline continuation

### 🔧 Needs Implementation (20%)

The remaining 20% consists of 6 major areas with 18 detailed subtasks:

1. **Complete SpaCy NER Integration** (3 tasks)
2. **Enhanced OpenIE Pipeline Integration** (3 tasks)
3. **Recursive Multi-hop Graph Resolution** (3 tasks)
4. **Fact Gathering and Scoring System** (3 tasks)
5. **Agent Pipeline Orchestration** (3 tasks)
6. **Final Response Generation System** (3 tasks)

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1. Complete SpaCy NER Integration
2. Enhanced OpenIE Pipeline Integration

### Phase 2: Intelligence (Weeks 3-4)
3. Recursive Multi-hop Graph Resolution
4. Fact Gathering and Scoring System

### Phase 3: Orchestration (Weeks 5-6)
5. Agent Pipeline Orchestration
6. Final Response Generation System

## Architecture Principles

### Entity Design
- **Generic Entities**: No positional/content context, only universal concepts
- **Normalized Forms**: Singular, non-conjugated (e.g., 'brain'/'brains' → 'brain')
- **Multi-language Support**: LLM-based normalization for Spanish, German, etc.

### Relation Design
- **Context Carriers**: Relations contain all contextual information
- **Multiple Relations**: Same entity pairs can have multiple relation types
- **Source Tracking**: Each relation links to specific DocumentChunk

### Graph Schema
```
Document → CONTAINS → DocumentChunk → MENTIONS → Entity
Entity ← SUBJECT/OBJECT ← Relation → OBJECT/SUBJECT → Entity
Relation → EXTRACTED_FROM → DocumentChunk
```

## Key Components

### 1. Ingestion Pipeline
- **Input**: Any source (document, audio, video, web)
- **Process**: markitdown → SpaCy NER → OpenIE → embeddings → Neo4j
- **Output**: Knowledge graph with entities, relations, and source tracking

### 2. Resolution Pipeline
- **Input**: User query
- **Process**: Entity extraction → multi-hop traversal → fact gathering → scoring
- **Output**: Ranked facts with citations and confidence scores

### 3. Response Generation
- **Input**: Gathered facts with sources
- **Process**: LLM synthesis with citation integration
- **Output**: Comprehensive response with timestamps, references, and sources

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Process any document type with proper entity/relation extraction
- [ ] Perform intelligent multi-hop graph traversal
- [ ] Generate responses with accurate citations and timestamps
- [ ] Support multiple languages (English, Spanish, German)
- [ ] Maintain intermediate files for debugging and continuation

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Entity normalization accuracy > 90%
- [ ] Relation extraction precision > 85%
- [ ] Response relevance score > 90%
- [ ] Citation accuracy 100%
- [ ] Processing time < 30s for typical documents

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Modular architecture with clear interfaces
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- [ ] Scalable to large document collections
- [ ] Support for incremental updates
- [ ] Full test coverage for critical components

## Getting Started

1. **Review Current Implementation**: Examine existing codebase in `packages/morag-graph/`
2. **Choose Starting Point**: Recommend beginning with SpaCy NER integration
3. **Follow Task Files**: Each numbered file contains detailed implementation steps
4. **Test Incrementally**: Use existing test framework for validation
5. **Document Progress**: Update task completion status

## Dependencies

### External
- SpaCy (with language models: en_core_web_lg, de_core_news_lg, es_core_news_lg)
- Neo4j (>=5.15.0)
- Qdrant vector database
- Google Gemini API for LLM operations

### Internal
- morag-core: Base models and interfaces
- morag-graph: Graph operations and storage
- morag-services: Service layer and pipeline
- morag-reasoning: LLM agents and fact extraction

## Notes

- All tasks are designed to work with the existing modular architecture
- Intermediate file generation is crucial for debugging and pipeline continuation
- LLM-based normalization is preferred over static patterns for multi-language support
- The system should avoid static/magic terms, letting LLM handle domain capture
