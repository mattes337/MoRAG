# MoRAG High-Level Implementation Tasks

This directory contains the comprehensive task breakdown for implementing the complete MoRAG (Modular Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline as outlined in the high-level overview.

## Overview

The MoRAG system implements a three-stage pipeline:

1. **Ingest Sources** → Convert, extract entities/relations, build knowledge graph
2. **Resolve Entities/Relations** → Multi-hop graph traversal, fact gathering
3. **Generate Response** → LLM-powered synthesis with citations

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Already Implemented (95%)

- **Document Conversion**: ✅ Complete markitdown integration for all content types (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Text, Images, Audio, Video, Web, Archives)
- **Entity/Relation Extraction**: ✅ Complete LLM-based extraction with full SpaCy NER integration and OpenIE pipeline
- **Graph Storage**: ✅ Full Neo4j implementation with proper Document/DocumentChunk schema and advanced operations
- **Vector Storage**: ✅ Complete Qdrant integration with hybrid Neo4j+Qdrant architecture for optimal performance
- **Query Resolution**: ✅ Advanced hybrid retrieval combining vector similarity and graph traversal
- **Intermediate Files**: ✅ System for debugging and pipeline continuation
- **Multi-language Support**: ✅ SpaCy models for English, German, Spanish with automatic language detection
- **Entity Normalization**: ✅ LLM-based normalization supporting multiple languages
- **OpenIE Integration**: ✅ Complete pipeline with Stanford OpenIE, sentence processing, triplet validation, entity linking

### 🔧 Needs Implementation (5%)

The remaining 5% consists of 2 major areas with 6 detailed subtasks:

1. **✅ Complete SpaCy NER Integration** (3 tasks) - COMPLETED
2. **✅ Enhanced OpenIE Pipeline Integration** (3 tasks) - COMPLETED
3. **Recursive Multi-hop Graph Resolution** (3 tasks) - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
4. **Fact Gathering and Scoring System** (3 tasks) - NEEDS ENHANCEMENT
5. **Agent Pipeline Orchestration** (3 tasks) - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
6. **Final Response Generation System** (3 tasks) - NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION

## Implementation Priority

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)
1. ✅ Complete SpaCy NER Integration - DONE
2. ✅ Enhanced OpenIE Pipeline Integration - DONE

### 🔧 Phase 2: Intelligence (Current Focus)
3. 🔧 Recursive Multi-hop Graph Resolution - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
4. 🔧 Fact Gathering and Scoring System - NEEDS ENHANCEMENT

### 📋 Phase 3: Orchestration (Next)
5. 📋 Agent Pipeline Orchestration - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
6. 📋 Final Response Generation System - NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION

## Architecture Principles

### Entity Design
- **Generic Entities**: No positional/content context, only universal concepts
- **Normalized Forms**: Singular, non-conjugated (e.g., 'brain'/'brains' → 'brain')
- **Multi-language Support**: LLM-based normalization for Spanish, German, etc.

### Relation Design
- **Context Carriers**: Relations contain all contextual information
- **Multiple Relations**: Same entity pairs can have multiple relation types
- **Source Tracking**: Each relation links to specific DocumentChunk

### Graph Schema
```
Document → CONTAINS → DocumentChunk → MENTIONS → Entity
Entity ← SUBJECT/OBJECT ← Relation → OBJECT/SUBJECT → Entity
Relation → EXTRACTED_FROM → DocumentChunk
```

## Key Components

### 1. Ingestion Pipeline
- **Input**: Any source (document, audio, video, web)
- **Process**: markitdown → SpaCy NER → OpenIE → embeddings → Neo4j
- **Output**: Knowledge graph with entities, relations, and source tracking

### 2. Resolution Pipeline
- **Input**: User query
- **Process**: Entity extraction → multi-hop traversal → fact gathering → scoring
- **Output**: Ranked facts with citations and confidence scores

### 3. Response Generation
- **Input**: Gathered facts with sources
- **Process**: LLM synthesis with citation integration
- **Output**: Comprehensive response with timestamps, references, and sources

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [x] Process any document type with proper entity/relation extraction
- [x] Perform intelligent multi-hop graph traversal (basic implementation)
- [ ] Generate responses with accurate citations and timestamps
- [x] Support multiple languages (English, Spanish, German)
- [x] Maintain intermediate files for debugging and continuation

### Quality Requirements

- [x] Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- [x] Scalable to large document collections (via Qdrant+Neo4j)
- [x] Support for incremental updates
- [ ] Full test coverage for critical components

## Getting Started

1. **Review Current Implementation**: Examine existing codebase in `packages/morag-graph/`
2. **Choose Starting Point**: Recommend beginning with SpaCy NER integration
3. **Follow Task Files**: Each numbered file contains detailed implementation steps
4. **Test Incrementally**: Use existing test framework for validation
5. **Document Progress**: Update task completion status

## Dependencies

### External
- SpaCy (with language models: en_core_web_lg, de_core_news_lg, es_core_news_lg)
- Neo4j (>=5.15.0)
- Qdrant vector database
- Google Gemini API for LLM operations

### Internal
- morag-core: Base models and interfaces
- morag-graph: Graph operations and storage
- morag-services: Service layer and pipeline
- morag-reasoning: LLM agents and fact extraction

## Notes

- All tasks are designed to work with the existing modular architecture
- Intermediate file generation is crucial for debugging and pipeline continuation
- LLM-based normalization is preferred over static patterns for multi-language support
- The system should avoid static/magic terms, letting LLM handle domain capture
