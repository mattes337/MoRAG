# MoRAG Implementation Tasks

This directory contains individual task files for implementing the Multimodal RAG Ingestion Pipeline. Each task is designed to be implemented independently and can be tackled in sequence or parallel depending on dependencies.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES

### 1. Test-Driven Development (MANDATORY)
- **ALL tasks must include comprehensive tests**
- **You may ONLY advance to the next task once ALL tests pass**
- **Each task includes mandatory test coverage requirements**
- **Integration tests must pass before proceeding**

### 2. Advancement Blockers
- Each task has specific "Advancement Blocker" requirements
- These include test coverage thresholds and integration requirements
- **Cannot proceed without meeting ALL criteria**

### 3. Plan Updates
- If changes are made to any task, ALL successor tasks must be reviewed and updated accordingly
- Dependencies must be maintained and validated
- Test requirements must be propagated to dependent tasks

## Task Overview

The tasks are organized into the following categories:

### Core Infrastructure
- `01-project-setup.md` - Initial project structure and configuration
- `02-api-framework.md` - FastAPI service setup with async support
- `03-database-setup.md` - Qdrant vector database configuration
- `04-task-queue.md` - Async task processing with Celery/Redis

### Document Processing
- `05-document-parser.md` - Document parsing with unstructured.io/docling
- `06-semantic-chunking.md` - Intelligent text chunking with spaCy
- `07-summary-generation.md` - CRAG-inspired summarization with Gemini

### Media Processing
- `08-audio-processing.md` - Speech-to-text with Whisper
- `09-video-processing.md` - Video extraction and processing
- `10-image-processing.md` - Image captioning and OCR
- `11-youtube-integration.md` - YouTube video download and processing

### Web Content
- `12-web-scraping.md` - Website content extraction
- `13-content-conversion.md` - HTML to Markdown conversion

### Embedding & Storage
- `14-gemini-integration.md` - Gemini API integration for embeddings
- `15-vector-storage.md` - Qdrant storage implementation
- `16-metadata-management.md` - Metadata extraction and association

### API & Orchestration
- `17-ingestion-api.md` - RESTful ingestion endpoints
- `18-status-tracking.md` - Progress tracking and webhooks
- `19-n8n-workflows.md` - Orchestration workflow setup

### Testing & Deployment
- `20-testing-framework.md` - Unit and integration tests
- `21-monitoring-logging.md` - Logging and basic monitoring
- `22-deployment-config.md` - Docker and deployment configuration

## Implementation Order

Recommended implementation sequence:
1. Core Infrastructure (01-04)
2. Gemini Integration (14) - Early setup for testing
3. Document Processing (05-07)
4. Embedding & Storage (15-16)
5. API Development (17-18)
6. Media Processing (08-11)
7. Web Content (12-13)
8. Orchestration (19)
9. Testing & Deployment (20-22)

## Dependencies

Each task file includes:
- Prerequisites and dependencies
- Detailed implementation steps
- Code examples and configurations
- **Mandatory Testing Requirements** (NEW)
- **Advancement Blockers** (NEW)
- Success criteria with coverage requirements
- Integration test requirements

## Testing Framework Requirements

### Test Categories (All Mandatory)
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **Performance Tests**: Validate performance benchmarks
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows

### Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: >95% coverage for core modules
- **Integration Tests**: >90% coverage for API endpoints
- **Error Handling**: 100% coverage for exception paths
- **Critical Paths**: 100% coverage for data flow

### Test Execution Order
```bash
# 1. Unit tests (must pass first)
pytest tests/test_XX_*.py -v --cov

# 2. Integration tests (after unit tests pass)
pytest tests/test_XX_integration.py -v

# 3. Performance tests (after integration tests pass)
pytest tests/test_XX_performance.py -v -m performance

# 4. Advancement blocker validation
# (specific commands in each task)
```

### Advancement Criteria
- All tests must pass with required coverage
- Integration requirements must be met
- Performance benchmarks must be achieved
- No critical issues in code quality checks
