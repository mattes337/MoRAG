   # New imports
   from morag_audio import AudioProcessor
   ```

2. **Update API Integration**
   - Modify API routes to use package-specific processors

- `scripts/validate-migration.py` - Migration validation
- `scripts/rollback-migration.sh` - Rollback script
- `scripts/package-health-check.py` - Package health validation

**Migration Script Features:**
1. **Automated Migration**
   - Backup current configuration
   - Install new package dependencies
   - Update configuration files
   - Validate system functionality

2. **Validation Tools**
   - Test all processing types
   - Verify package integration
   - Check performance benchmarks
   - Validate API functionality

3. **Rollback Capability**
   - Restore previous configuration
   - Revert to monolithic deployment
   - Preserve data integrity
   - Minimal downtime rollback

### Step 5: Update CI/CD Pipelines

**Pipeline updates:**
- Package-specific build and test pipelines
- Integration testing across packages
- Container build and deployment
- Performance regression testing

**Actions:**
1. **Package Build Pipelines**
   - Individual package testing and building
   - Package publishing to registries
   - Version management and tagging
   - Security scanning for each package

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Cross-package integration tests
