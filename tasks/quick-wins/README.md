# MoRAG Quick Wins

This directory contains task specifications for low-effort, high-impact improvements to MoRAG that can be implemented independently and provide immediate value while larger architectural changes are planned.

## Overview

Based on comprehensive research analysis of leading RAG systems (KG2RAG, INRAExplorer, GraphRAG, LightRAG, and others), these quick wins address immediate opportunities to improve MoRAG's performance, reliability, and usability.

**Important**: All implementations are designed for MoRAG's multi-language support. No hardcoded language-specific text or patterns are used. Instead, LLM-based approaches are employed for language-agnostic processing, with fallback mechanisms for when LLM services are unavailable.
