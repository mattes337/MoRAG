# Remote GPU Worker Support - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for adding remote GPU worker support to the MoRAG system. The goal is to enable GPU-intensive tasks to be processed on remote machines while maintaining the existing CPU-based processing capabilities.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing System
- **Main Server**: CPU-only server running FastAPI, Redis, and Qdrant
- **Local Workers**: Celery workers running on the same machine as the server
- **Task Queue**: Redis-based Celery task queue with single queue ("celery")
- **File Handling**: Shared volume system (`/app/temp`) for file access between API and workers
- **Processing Types**: Audio (Whisper), Video (FFmpeg), Document (docling), Web, YouTube, Image

### Current Limitations
- All processing happens on CPU-only server
- Audio/video processing is slow without GPU acceleration
- No task prioritization based on worker capabilities
- File sharing requires shared volumes (not available for remote workers)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Tasks 1-4)
1. **Task Queue Architecture** - Implement priority queues for GPU vs CPU tasks
2. **Worker Registration System** - Allow workers to register capabilities and receive appropriate tasks
3. **File Transfer Service** - Secure file transfer between server and remote workers
4. **Worker Communication Protocol** - Heartbeat, health checking, and connection management

### Phase 2: Task Routing & Distribution (Tasks 5-7)
5. **Task Classification System** - Identify GPU-intensive vs CPU-suitable tasks
6. **Priority Queue Implementation** - Route tasks to appropriate worker types
7. **Failover Mechanisms** - Handle GPU worker unavailability

### Phase 3: Remote Worker Implementation (Tasks 8-10)
8. **Remote Worker Package** - Standalone worker that can run on remote machines
9. **Authentication & Security** - Secure connection and authorization for remote workers
10. **Configuration Management** - Separate configs for GPU workers vs CPU workers

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Management (Tasks 11-12)
11. **Monitoring Dashboard** - Track worker status, task distribution, and performance
12. **Deployment & Documentation** - Docker configs, setup guides, and operational docs

## Key Technical Decisions

### Queue Architecture
- **GPU Queue**: `gpu_tasks` - High priority queue for GPU-intensive tasks
- **CPU Queue**: `cpu_tasks` - Standard queue for CPU-suitable tasks
- **Fallback Queue**: `fallback_tasks` - GPU tasks that can fallback to CPU

### File Transfer Protocol
- **Upload Endpoint**: `/api/v1/workers/files/upload` - Server sends files to workers
- **Download Endpoint**: `/api/v1/workers/files/download` - Workers send results back
- **Security**: JWT tokens for worker authentication, file encryption in transit
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of transferred files after processing

### Worker Types
- **GPU Workers**: Remote workers with CUDA/GPU capabilities
- **CPU Workers**: Local or remote workers with CPU-only processing
- **Hybrid Workers**: Workers that can handle both GPU and CPU tasks

## Success Criteria

1. **Performance**: GPU tasks process 5-10x faster on GPU workers vs CPU workers
2. **Reliability**: System maintains 99%+ uptime with automatic failover
3. **Scalability**: Support for multiple remote GPU workers
4. **Security**: Encrypted file transfer and authenticated worker connections
5. **Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into worker status and task distribution

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)
- **Week 3**: Phase 2 (Task Routing)
- **Week 4**: Phase 3 (Remote Workers)
- **Week 5**: Phase 4 (Monitoring & Deployment)
- **Week 6**: Testing, Documentation, and Production Deployment

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Redis for queue management (already available)
- JWT for authentication
- Cryptography for file encryption
- WebSocket or HTTP/2 for real-time communication

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing Celery task system
- Current file upload/handling system
- MoRAG modular architecture (audio, video, document packages)

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Network Failures**: Implement robust retry mechanisms and task redistribution
2. **Worker Failures**: Automatic failover to CPU workers when GPU workers unavailable
3. **File Transfer Failures**: Checksums, retry logic, and cleanup mechanisms
4. **Security Concerns**: End-to-end encryption, token-based auth, and audit logging

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this implementation plan
2. Begin with Task 1: Queue Architecture Implementation
3. Set up development environment for testing remote worker scenarios
4. Create test GPU worker setup for validation
