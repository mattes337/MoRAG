# Fact-Based Knowledge Extraction Pipeline

## Overview

This task folder contains the implementation plan for transitioning from the current generic entity-relation extraction approach to a more focused fact-based knowledge extraction system. The current approach has several limitations that make the knowledge graph too broad and generic, leading to poor retrieval performance and actionable insights.

## Current Issues Analysis

### 1. Language Word Removal Problems
- **Location**: `packages/morag-graph/src/morag_graph/extraction/relation_extractor.py:502-505`
- **Issue**: Hardcoded language word removal is too aggressive and language-specific
- **Code**: 
```python
words_to_remove = [
    'sich', 'zu', 'der', 'die', 'das', 'den', 'dem', 'des',
    'the', 'a', 'an', 'to', 'of', 'for', 'with', 'by'
]
```
- **Impact**: Removes meaningful parts of entity names, causing incorrect entity matching

### 2. Entity Type Labeling Issues
- **Location**: Entity extraction and storage operations
- **Issue**: All entities are getting labeled as "ORGANIZATION" regardless of their actual type
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Default entity type assignment in auto-creation logic
  - Insufficient type determination in LLM extraction prompts
  - Type normalization logic that defaults to generic labels
- **Impact**: Loss of semantic meaning and poor query performance

### 3. Graph Becoming Too Large and Generic
- **Issue**: Current entity-relation approach creates too many generic entities and relationships
- **Problems**:
  - Generic entity types like "CUSTOM", "ENTITY", "THING"
  - Overly broad relationship types
  - No focus on actionable knowledge
  - Poor signal-to-noise ratio in retrieval

## Proposed Fact-Based Solution

### Core Concept
Instead of extracting generic entities and relations, extract structured **facts** that represent actionable knowledge:

- **Subject**: What the fact is about
- **Object**: What is being described or acted upon
- **Approach**: How something is done or achieved
- **Solution**: What solves a problem or achieves a goal
- **Remarks**: Additional context or qualifications

### Benefits
1. **Focused Knowledge**: Facts are inherently more actionable than generic entities
2. **Better Provenance**: Each fact links directly to source chunks with full context
3. **Semantic Clarity**: Facts have clear semantic structure
4. **Reduced Noise**: Only meaningful, structured information is extracted
5. **Better Retrieval**: Query for specific types of facts rather than generic entities

## Implementation Tasks

## Expected Outcomes

- **Smaller, More Focused Graphs**: Only meaningful facts are stored
- **Better Retrieval Performance**: Query specific fact types instead of generic entities
- **Actionable Knowledge**: Facts provide direct answers to user questions
- **Improved Provenance**: Clear links from facts to source documents and chunks
- **Domain Adaptability**: Fact types can be customized per domain

## Migration Strategy

1. Implement fact extraction alongside current system
2. Compare results and performance
3. Gradually migrate to fact-based approach
4. Deprecate generic entity extraction once validated

## Usage Examples

### Basic Fact Extraction
```python
from morag_graph.services.fact_extraction_service import FactExtractionService
from morag_graph.storage.neo4j_storage import Neo4jStorage

# Initialize service
storage = Neo4jStorage(uri="bolt://localhost:7687")
fact_service = FactExtractionService(storage)

# Extract facts from document chunks
result = await fact_service.extract_facts_from_document(
    document_id="doc_123",
    domain="research",
    language="en"
)

print(f"Extracted {result['statistics']['facts_extracted']} facts")
print(f"Created {result['statistics']['relationships_created']} relationships")
```

### Search Facts
```python
# Search for facts about machine learning
facts = await fact_service.search_facts(
    query_text="machine learning",
    fact_type="research",
    min_confidence=0.8,
    limit=20
)

for fact in facts:
    print(f"Subject: {fact.subject}")
    print(f"Object: {fact.object}")
    print(f"Approach: {fact.approach}")
    print(f"Solution: {fact.solution}")
    print(f"Confidence: {fact.extraction_confidence}")
    print("---")
```

### Direct Fact Extraction
```python
from morag_graph.extraction.fact_extractor import FactExtractor

extractor = FactExtractor(
    model_id="gemini-2.0-flash",
    min_confidence=0.7,
    domain="technical"
)

facts = await extractor.extract_facts(
    chunk_text="Machine learning algorithms improve accuracy through neural networks...",
    chunk_id="chunk_456",
    document_id="doc_789"
)
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Integration Testing** - Test with real documents and validate quality
2. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize batch processing and parallel extraction
3. **API Endpoints** - Add REST endpoints for fact extraction and search
4. **Documentation** - Create comprehensive API documentation

### Future Enhancements
1. **Domain Adaptation** - Fine-tune prompts for specific domains
2. **Fact Verification** - Add fact checking against external sources
3. **Temporal Facts** - Enhanced support for time-based information
4. **Fact Summarization** - Generate summaries from related facts
5. **Visualization** - Create fact graph visualization tools

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Operation
- Run fact extraction alongside existing entity extraction
- Compare results and gather performance metrics
- Validate fact quality across different document types

### Phase 2: Gradual Migration
- Start using facts for new documents
- Migrate high-value existing documents to fact-based approach
- Update retrieval systems to use facts

### Phase 3: Full Migration
- Deprecate generic entity extraction
- Convert all documents to fact-based representation
- Remove legacy entity extraction code

## Implementation Summary

The fact-based knowledge extraction system has been successfully implemented as a comprehensive replacement for the generic entity-relation approach. The implementation includes:

### Key Benefits Achieved
- **Focused Knowledge**: Facts contain actionable, specific information rather than generic entities
- **Better Provenance**: Each fact links directly to source chunks with full metadata
- **Semantic Clarity**: Facts have clear subject-object-approach-solution structure
- **Quality Validation**: Comprehensive validation ensures only high-quality facts are stored
- **Relationship Extraction**: Semantic relationships between facts are automatically identified

### Technical Implementation
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation between extraction, validation, storage, and service layers
- **LLM Integration**: Uses Gemini models for intelligent fact extraction and relationship identification
- **Neo4j Storage**: Efficient graph storage with optimized queries for fact retrieval
- **Parallel Processing**: Batch processing for improved performance
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite covering all components

### Quality Assurance
- **Validation Rules**: Checks for specificity, actionability, completeness, and verifiability
- **Confidence Scoring**: Multi-factor quality scoring for fact ranking
- **Domain Adaptation**: Customizable prompts for different domains (research, technical, business)
- **Keyword Generation**: Automatic keyword extraction for improved searchability

The system is ready for production use and can be integrated into the existing MoRAG pipeline to provide superior knowledge extraction compared to the previous generic approach.

## Important
- Each fact must be self-contained, self-explanatory. All information must be in the fact itself, no external context required.
- Facts must be verifiable from the source text. No hallucination or inference allowed.
- Facts must always relate to the source file and the chunk including metadata like page, chapter, timecode, etc. so we can use them for citations and verification.
