# Document Processing Improvements Overview

## Project Summary

This project focuses on improving the MoRAG document processing and search functionality with five specific enhancements that will significantly improve the quality, efficiency, and usability of the document processing pipeline.

## Improvements Overview

### 1. Fix PDF Chunking to Preserve Word Integrity
**Task**: [task-01-fix-pdf-chunking-word-integrity.md](./task-01-fix-pdf-chunking-word-integrity.md)

**Problem**: Current chunking algorithm splits words mid-character, breaking semantic coherence and reducing retrieval quality.

**Solution**: 
- Implement intelligent word boundary detection
- Enhance sentence boundary detection with better regex patterns
- Add semantic chunking based on document structure
- Ensure chunks never split words mid-character

**Impact**: Better chunk coherence, improved search accuracy, preserved document context

### 2. Optimize Search Endpoint Embedding Strategy
**Task**: [task-02-optimize-search-embedding-strategy.md](./task-02-optimize-search-embedding-strategy.md)

**Problem**: Search endpoint may be using inefficient batch embedding APIs for single query text, adding unnecessary overhead.

**Solution**:
- Streamline embedding generation for single search queries
- Remove unnecessary batch processing overhead
- Implement search-specific embedding caching
- Add performance monitoring and optimization

**Impact**: Faster search response times, reduced API calls, better resource utilization

### 3. Investigate and Fix Text Duplication in Search Results
**Task**: [task-03-fix-text-duplication-search-results.md](./task-03-fix-text-duplication-search-results.md)

**Problem**: Search results return text both in metadata fields and as separate content, causing redundancy and larger payloads.

**Solution**:
- Analyze current storage patterns to identify duplication source
- Optimize storage strategy to eliminate redundancy
- Clean up search response formatting
- Implement deduplication logic

**Impact**: Reduced response payload size, cleaner API responses, improved storage efficiency

### 4. Increase Default Chunk Size for Better Context
**Task**: [task-04-increase-default-chunk-size.md](./task-04-increase-default-chunk-size.md)

**Problem**: Current default chunk size of 1000 characters is too small for meaningful context in modern LLM applications.

**Solution**:
- Increase default chunk size from 1000 to 4000 characters
- Make chunk size configurable via environment variables
- Add validation for embedding model token limits
- Maintain backward compatibility

**Impact**: Better context preservation, improved retrieval quality, fewer fragmented chunks

### 5. Implement Document Replacement Functionality
**Task**: [task-05-implement-document-replacement.md](./task-05-implement-document-replacement.md)

**Problem**: Re-processing the same document creates duplicate entries in vector storage with no way to replace existing documents.

**Solution**:
- Add document identifier support for tracking documents
- Implement replacement logic that deletes old vectors before adding new ones
- Add document management API endpoints
- Support both user-defined and auto-generated document IDs

**Impact**: Proper document lifecycle management, no duplicate entries, ability to update documents

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. **Start with Task 4 (Chunk Size)**: Easiest to implement, provides immediate benefits
2. **Implement Task 3 (Text Deduplication)**: Investigate and fix storage/response issues
3. **Begin Task 1 (Word Integrity)**: Start with word boundary preservation

### Phase 2: Core Improvements (Week 3-4)
1. **Complete Task 1 (Word Integrity)**: Finish semantic chunking implementation
2. **Implement Task 5 (Document Replacement)**: Add document management capabilities
3. **Start Task 2 (Search Optimization)**: Begin embedding strategy optimization

### Phase 3: Optimization and Testing (Week 5-6)
1. **Complete Task 2 (Search Optimization)**: Finish embedding improvements
2. **Integration testing**: Test all improvements together
3. **Performance validation**: Ensure improvements don't degrade performance
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation and examples

## Expected Benefits

### Quality Improvements
