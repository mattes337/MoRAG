# Task 07: Summary Generation with Gemini

## Overview
Implement CRAG-inspired summarization with Google Gemini API for intelligent document processing. This task enhances the existing basic summary generation with advanced techniques for better context preservation and retrieval augmentation.

## Objectives
- âœ… Enhance existing Gemini service with advanced summarization strategies
- âœ… Implement CRAG-inspired multi-level summarization
- âœ… Add context-aware summary generation based on document type and content
- âœ… Create adaptive summary length based on content complexity
- âœ… Implement summary quality assessment and refinement
- âœ… Add comprehensive testing for all summarization features

## Current State Analysis
The basic Gemini service already exists in `src/morag/services/embedding.py` with:
- Basic summary generation with configurable styles
- Integration with document processing pipeline
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Summary Service Architecture
1. **Extend GeminiService class** with advanced summarization methods
2. **Create SummaryStrategy enum** for different summarization approaches
3. **Implement SummaryConfig dataclass** for fine-grained control
4. **Add content analysis** for adaptive summarization

### Phase 2: CRAG-Inspired Multi-Level Summarization
1. **Hierarchical summarization** - chunk â†’ section â†’ document level
2. **Context-aware prompting** based on document structure
3. **Retrieval-augmented summarization** using related content
4. **Progressive refinement** of summaries

### Phase 3: Content-Type Specific Strategies
1. **Academic papers** - abstract, methodology, findings focus
2. **Technical documentation** - key concepts and procedures
3. **Business documents** - decisions, actions, and outcomes
4. **General content** - main ideas and supporting details

### Phase 4: Quality Assessment and Refinement
1. **Summary quality metrics** - coherence, completeness, conciseness
2. **Automatic refinement** based on quality scores
3. **Fallback strategies** for low-quality summaries
4. **User feedback integration** for continuous improvement

## Technical Specifications

### Enhanced Summary Configuration
```python
@dataclass
class SummaryConfig:
    strategy: SummaryStrategy
    max_length: int = 150
    min_length: int = 50
    style: str = "concise"
    focus_areas: List[str] = None
    context_window: int = 2000
    quality_threshold: float = 0.7
    enable_refinement: bool = True
    preserve_structure: bool = False
```

### Summary Strategies
- **EXTRACTIVE**: Key sentence extraction with ranking
- **ABSTRACTIVE**: Full rewriting with Gemini
- **HYBRID**: Combination of extractive and abstractive
- **HIERARCHICAL**: Multi-level progressive summarization
- **CONTEXTUAL**: Context-aware with related content

### Quality Metrics
- **Coherence**: Logical flow and consistency
- **Completeness**: Coverage of key information
- **Conciseness**: Information density
- **Relevance**: Alignment with content focus
- **Readability**: Clarity and accessibility

## Testing Requirements
- **Unit tests** for each summary strategy (>95% coverage)
- **Integration tests** with document processing pipeline
- **Performance tests** for large documents
- **Quality assessment tests** with known good/bad examples
- **Error handling tests** for API failures and edge cases

## Success Criteria
1. âœ… All existing tests continue to pass
2. âœ… Enhanced summary quality compared to basic implementation
3. âœ… Adaptive summarization based on content type and complexity
4. âœ… Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
5. âœ… Performance within acceptable limits (< 5s per chunk)
6. âœ… Comprehensive test coverage (>95% unit, >90% integration)
