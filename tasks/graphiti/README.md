# MoRAG-Graphiti Integration Implementation Plan

This directory contains a comprehensive 12-step implementation plan for integrating Graphiti with MoRAG, replacing the existing Neo4j-based knowledge graph storage with Graphiti's episode-based architecture.

## Overview

Graphiti is a temporal knowledge graph system that uses episodes to represent knowledge, providing built-in deduplication, temporal queries, and hybrid search capabilities. This integration will enhance MoRAG's knowledge representation and search functionality while maintaining backward compatibility.

The implementation is divided into 4 phases with 12 distinct steps, each building upon the previous while maintaining working functionality throughout the process.

## Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Steps 1-3)

### [Step 1: Graphiti Setup and Configuration](./step-01-graphiti-setup.md)
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Deliverable**: Working Graphiti connection to Neo4j with basic configuration
**Testing**: Connection validation and basic episode creation

### [Step 2: Basic Search Integration](./step-02-basic-search.md)
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Deliverable**: Graphiti search service with result adapters
**Testing**: Search functionality and performance validation

### [Step 3: Document Ingestion Service](./step-03-document-ingestion.md)
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Deliverable**: Document ingestion pipeline using Graphiti episodes
**Testing**: Document and chunk ingestion validation

## Phase 2: Core Integration (Steps 4-7)

### [Step 4: Adapter Layer](./step-04-adapter-layer.md)
**Duration**: 4-5 days
**Deliverable**: Complete adapter system bridging MoRAG and Graphiti models
**Testing**: Full document lifecycle with entity/relation validation

### [Step 5: Entity and Relation Migration](./step-05-entity-relation-migration.md)
**Duration**: 3-4 days  
**Deliverable**: Graphiti-based entity/relation storage replacing direct Neo4j calls
**Testing**: Entity deduplication and relationship integrity validation

### [Step 6: Ingestion Coordinator Integration](./step-06-coordinator-integration.md)
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Deliverable**: Updated IngestionCoordinator with Graphiti support and fallback options
**Testing**: End-to-end ingestion pipeline with both Graphiti and legacy modes

### [Step 7: Chunk-Entity Relationship Handling](./step-07-chunk-entity-relationships.md)
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Deliverable**: Proper chunk-to-entity mapping using Graphiti's episode model
**Testing**: Chunk-entity relationship integrity and search functionality

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Steps 8-10)

### [Step 8: Temporal Query Implementation](./step-08-temporal-queries.md)
**Duration**: 3-4 days  
**Deliverable**: Point-in-time queries and document versioning support  
**Testing**: Temporal query accuracy and historical data retrieval

### [Step 9: Custom Schema and Entity Types](./step-09-custom-schema.md)
**Duration**: 3-4 days  
**Deliverable**: MoRAG-specific entity types and relationship schemas in Graphiti
**Testing**: Custom entity validation and schema compliance

### [Step 10: Hybrid Search Enhancement](./step-10-hybrid-search.md)
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Deliverable**: Advanced search with semantic, keyword, and graph traversal  
**Testing**: Search quality metrics and performance optimization

## Phase 4: Migration and Production (Steps 11-12)

### [Step 11: Data Migration Strategy](./step-11-data-migration.md)
**Duration**: 4-5 days  
**Deliverable**: Migration scripts and procedures for existing Neo4j data  
**Testing**: Migration validation and rollback procedures

### [Step 12: Production Deployment and Cleanup](./step-12-production-deployment.md)
**Duration**: 3-4 days  
**Deliverable**: Production-ready Graphiti integration with legacy code removal
**Testing**: Full system integration tests and performance validation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Working Implementation Principle
Each step must result in a working implementation that can be:
- Tested independently
- Demonstrated to stakeholders
- Used as a fallback if subsequent steps fail
- Integrated with existing MoRAG functionality

### Testing Strategy
Every step includes:
- **Unit Tests**: Component-level validation
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-component functionality
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking against current implementation
- **Validation Tests**: Data integrity and correctness

### Risk Mitigation
- **Parallel Implementation**: Maintain existing functionality during transition
- **Feature Flags**: Toggle between Graphiti and legacy implementations
- **Rollback Plans**: Clear procedures for reverting changes
- **Incremental Deployment**: Gradual rollout with monitoring

## Dependencies

### Required Software
- Python 3.10+
- Neo4j 5.26+ or FalkorDB 1.1.2+
- OpenAI API key (for LLM inference and embeddings)

### Python Packages
```bash
pip install graphiti-core
pip install neo4j
pip install openai
```

### Optional Enhancements
```bash
pip install graphiti-core[falkordb]  # For FalkorDB support
pip install graphiti-core[anthropic] # For Anthropic LLM support
```

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality
- **Reduction**: 60-80% reduction in Neo4j-specific code
- **Maintainability**: Simplified graph database operations
- **Testability**: Improved test coverage and reliability

### Performance
- **Ingestion Speed**: Maintain or improve current performance
- **Search Latency**: Sub-second response times
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient resource utilization

### Functionality
- **Feature Parity**: All current features maintained
- **Enhanced Search**: Hybrid search capabilities
- **Temporal Queries**: Point-in-time data retrieval
- **Entity Resolution**: Improved deduplication
