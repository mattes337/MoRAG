# MoRAG-Graphiti Integration Implementation Plan

This directory contains a comprehensive 12-step implementation plan for integrating Graphiti with MoRAG, replacing the existing Neo4j-based knowledge graph storage with Graphiti's episode-based architecture.

## Overview

Graphiti is a temporal knowledge graph system that uses episodes to represent knowledge, providing built-in deduplication, temporal queries, and hybrid search capabilities. This integration will enhance MoRAG's knowledge representation and search functionality while maintaining backward compatibility.

The implementation is divided into 4 phases with 12 distinct steps, each building upon the previous while maintaining working functionality throughout the process.

**Testing**: Entity deduplication and relationship integrity validation
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented - GraphitiEntityStorage, migration utilities, batch processing, comprehensive tests

### [Step 6: Ingestion Coordinator Integration](./step-06-coordinator-integration.md) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Deliverable**: Updated IngestionCoordinator with Graphiti support and fallback options
**Testing**: End-to-end ingestion pipeline with both Graphiti and legacy modes
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented - GraphitiIngestionService, GraphitiIntegrationService, backend selection, fallback mechanisms, comprehensive tests

### [Step 7: Chunk-Entity Relationship Handling](./step-07-chunk-entity-relationships.md) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Deliverable**: Proper chunk-to-entity mapping using Graphiti's episode model
**Testing**: Chunk-entity relationship integrity and search functionality
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented - ChunkEntityRelationshipService, entity mention tracking, chunk-based search, comprehensive tests

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Steps 8-10)

### [Step 8: Temporal Query Implementation](./step-08-temporal-queries.md)
**Duration**: 3-4 days  
**Deliverable**: Point-in-time queries and document versioning support  
**Testing**: Temporal query accuracy and historical data retrieval

### [Step 9: Custom Schema and Entity Types](./step-09-custom-schema.md)
**Duration**: 3-4 days  
**Deliverable**: MoRAG-specific entity types and relationship schemas in Graphiti
**Testing**: Custom entity validation and schema compliance

### [Step 10: Hybrid Search Enhancement](./step-10-hybrid-search.md)
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Deliverable**: Advanced search with semantic, keyword, and graph traversal  
**Testing**: Search quality metrics and performance optimization

## Phase 4: Production Deployment ‚è≥ **PENDING**

### [Step 11: Production Deployment](./step-11-production-deployment.md) ‚è≥ **PENDING**
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Deliverable**: Production-ready Graphiti integration with comprehensive testing
**Testing**: Full system integration tests and performance validation
**Status**: ‚è≥ Not started - Depends on Phase 3 completion

### [Step 12: Legacy Code Cleanup](./step-12-legacy-cleanup.md) ‚è≥ **PENDING**
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Deliverable**: Remove obsolete Neo4j-based code superseded by Graphiti
**Testing**: Ensure no regressions after legacy code removal
**Status**: ‚è≥ Not started - Depends on Step 11 completion

**Note**: Migration tasks have been removed since we're starting with a fresh Graphiti implementation rather than migrating existing Neo4j data.

## Progress Summary

- **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ Completed - Basic Graphiti integration working
- **Phase 2**: ‚úÖ Completed - Core integration components implemented
- **Phase 3**: ‚è≥ Pending - Advanced features (temporal queries, custom schema, hybrid search)
- **Phase 4**: ‚è≥ Pending - Production deployment and legacy cleanup

## Current Status

**Core Implementation Complete**: Steps 1-7 have been successfully implemented, providing:
- Complete Graphiti integration with MoRAG
- Document-to-episode mapping with comprehensive adapters
- Entity and relation storage using Graphiti episodes
- Chunk-entity relationship tracking
- Integration service with fallback mechanisms
- Comprehensive test coverage

**Next Steps**: The remaining work focuses on advanced features and production deployment rather than core functionality.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Working Implementation Principle
Each step must result in a working implementation that can be:
- Tested independently
- Demonstrated to stakeholders
- Used as a fallback if subsequent steps fail
- Integrated with existing MoRAG functionality

### Testing Strategy
Every step includes:
- **Unit Tests**: Component-level validation
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-component functionality
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking against current implementation
- **Validation Tests**: Data integrity and correctness

### Risk Mitigation
- **Parallel Implementation**: Maintain existing functionality during transition
- **Feature Flags**: Toggle between Graphiti and legacy implementations
- **Rollback Plans**: Clear procedures for reverting changes
- **Incremental Deployment**: Gradual rollout with monitoring

## Dependencies

### Required Software
- Python 3.10+
- Neo4j 5.26+ or FalkorDB 1.1.2+
- OpenAI API key (for LLM inference and embeddings)

### Python Packages
```bash
pip install graphiti-core
pip install neo4j
pip install openai
```

### Optional Enhancements
```bash
pip install graphiti-core[falkordb]  # For FalkorDB support
pip install graphiti-core[anthropic] # For Anthropic LLM support
```

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality
- **Reduction**: 60-80% reduction in Neo4j-specific code
- **Maintainability**: Simplified graph database operations
- **Testability**: Improved test coverage and reliability

### Performance
- **Ingestion Speed**: Maintain or improve current performance
- **Search Latency**: Sub-second response times
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient resource utilization

### Functionality
- **Feature Parity**: All current features maintained
- **Enhanced Search**: Hybrid search capabilities
- **Temporal Queries**: Point-in-time data retrieval
