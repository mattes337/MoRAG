# **Graph-Augmented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System Requirements**

Version: 1.0  
Date: June 16, 2025

## **1\. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for enhancing an existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with a knowledge graph. The goal is to improve the precision, relevance, and contextual depth of responses generated by language models by incorporating structured relational information.

### **1.2 Scope**

This document covers the requirements for integrating knowledge graph capabilities into an existing RAG pipeline, from data ingestion and knowledge graph construction to augmented retrieval and response generation. It focuses on the core functionalities necessary to support complex, multi-hop reasoning and rich contextual understanding. It explicitly omits discussions of specific technologies, products, or external projects, focusing purely on system capabilities.

### **1.3 Definitions**

* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): A system that retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base and uses it to augment a language model's generation process, leading to more accurate and grounded responses.  
* Knowledge Graph (KG): A structured representation of knowledge that connects entities (nodes) through defined relationships (edges), enabling the system to understand complex associations and perform sophisticated reasoning.  
* Entity: A distinct item or concept within the knowledge domain (e.g., Pineal Gland, Borax, Enlightenment).  
* Relation: A defined connection or predicate between two entities (e.g., "is decalcified by," "is responsible for," "is contained in").  
* Embedding: A numerical vector representation of text or other data, capturing semantic meaning for similarity search.  
* Sparse Vector: A vector where most elements are zero, often used for keyword-based indexing.  
* Dense Vector: A vector where most elements are non-zero, capturing semantic meaning for similarity search.  
* Multi-hop Reasoning: The ability to answer questions that require connecting information across multiple entities and relationships within a knowledge graph.

## **2\. Goals and Objectives**

### **2.1 Overall Goal**

To significantly enhance the performance and accuracy of the existing RAG system by incorporating a knowledge graph, enabling deeper contextual understanding and improved reasoning capabilities for language model responses.

### **2.2 Specific Objectives**

* To accurately extract and represent key entities and their relationships from diverse unstructured and semi-structured documents.  
* To enable the RAG system to leverage relational knowledge for more precise and contextually rich information retrieval.  
* To support multi-hop reasoning for answering complex queries that require connecting disparate pieces of information.  
* To provide mechanisms for iterative context refinement driven by the language model.  
* To maintain traceability between generated answers and their source documents and graph paths.

## **3\. System Context**

### **3.1 Current System**

The existing RAG software currently relies on a vector database for semantic similarity search over document chunks. It retrieves chunks based on vector proximity to the user's query and passes them to the language model for response generation.

### **3.2 Augmented System**

The proposed enhancement involves introducing a knowledge graph component that works in conjunction with the existing document store. The system will:

* Ingest and process diverse document types (PDFs, audio transcripts, video transcripts, scraped websites).  
* Construct and maintain a dynamic knowledge graph from the processed documents.  
* Utilize the knowledge graph to identify subject keywords and relevant relationships for query augmentation.  
* Implement a multi-stage retrieval process that combines semantic search with graph traversal.  
* Pass structured knowledge graph paths and original document content to the language model for enhanced response generation.

## **4\. Functional Requirements**

### **4.1 Data Ingestion and Processing**

4.1.1 Document Parsing

* The system SHALL be able to parse text content from various document types, including:  
  * PDF files  
  * Audio transcripts  
  * Video transcripts  
  * Scraped website content (HTML, plain text)  
* The system SHALL preserve relevant metadata (e.g., document title, author, creation date, source URL/path) during parsing.

4.1.2 Text Segmentation

* The system SHALL be able to segment parsed text into logical units (e.g., chapters, sections, paragraphs, sentences) suitable for embedding and indexing.

4.1.3 Textual Feature Generation

* The system SHALL generate high-dimensional dense vector embeddings for textual segments for semantic similarity search.  
* The system SHALL generate sparse vector representations or keyword indices for textual content to support keyword-based retrieval.

### **4.2 Knowledge Graph Construction and Management**

4.2.1 Subject Keyword Identification

* The system SHALL be able to automatically identify primary subject keywords or entities from ingested documents (e.g., "Pineal Gland").

4.2.2 Relation Extraction

* The system SHALL be able to identify and extract relationships between identified entities within and across document segments.  
* The system SHALL support the definition and extraction of various relationship types (e.g., "is decalcified by," "is responsible for," "is contained in").  
* The system SHALL be capable of inferring implicit relationships based on contextual cues.

4.2.3 Graph Persistence

* The system SHALL store the constructed knowledge graph persistently, comprising nodes (entities) and edges (relations).

4.2.4 Node Attributes

* Each node in the knowledge graph SHALL include:  
  * A unique identifier.  
  * A concise, updated summary of the entity.  
  * A dense vector embedding of the entity's summary/description.  
  * Sparse vector or keyword indices related to the entity.  
  * Relationships linking to the specific source documents or chapters where the entity is mentioned or defined.

4.2.5 Graph Updates/Maintenance

* The system SHALL support incremental updates to the knowledge graph as new documents are ingested or existing ones are modified.  
* The system SHALL handle potential inconsistencies or redundancies during graph updates.

### **4.3 Query Processing and Retrieval (RAG Flow)**

4.3.1 User Query Reception

* The system SHALL receive a natural language query from the user.

4.3.2 Initial Keyword/Entity Identification from Query

* The system SHALL identify key entities or concepts within the user's query.

4.3.3 Graph Traversal Guidance (AI-driven path selection)

* Based on the identified query entities, the system SHALL query the knowledge graph to retrieve immediate relations (without full content).  
* A language model SHALL analyze these initial relations and propose relevant "paths to follow" within the knowledge graph to satisfy the query. This step enables multi-hop reasoning.  
* The system SHALL facilitate the language model's ability to iterate on path selection, requesting more information from the graph as needed to build a comprehensive context.

4.3.4 Contextual Information Retrieval (from KG and original docs)

* The system SHALL retrieve full content (textual passages) from the original documents corresponding to the selected knowledge graph paths and "auto-included" chapters (as specified by a defined relation).  
* The system SHALL also retrieve the relevant structured information (entities, relations, summaries) from the knowledge graph nodes identified in the paths.

4.3.5 Iterative Context Refinement

## **6\. Future Considerations**

This document focuses on the core requirements for the initial implementation of a graph-augmented RAG system. Future considerations for a more advanced system might include:

* Automated "checking for MCP/Tool" capabilities, where the system can proactively identify opportunities to automate recurring information extraction or reasoning patterns.  
* User interfaces for knowledge graph visualization and manual curation.  
* Advanced reasoning capabilities beyond simple path traversal, such as inductive or deductive reasoning.  
* Feedback loops for continuous improvement of relation extraction and response generation based on user interaction.
