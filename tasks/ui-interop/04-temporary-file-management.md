# Temporary File Management System

## Overview
Implement a temporary file storage system that allows UI applications to access intermediate files generated during document processing.

## Requirements

### File Storage System
- Create temporary file storage for intermediate files
- Support multiple file types per processing session:
  - Original uploaded file
  - Intermediate markdown file
  - Metadata JSON file
  - Processing logs
  - Any other generated artifacts

### REST Endpoints for File Access
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/files/temp/{session_id}/{filename}`

**Purpose**: Download intermediate files generated during processing.

**Features**:
- Support both streaming and direct download
- Content-type detection based on file extension
- Range request support for large files
- Secure access with session validation

### File Lifecycle Management
- Automatic cleanup after configurable retention period
- Manual cleanup endpoints for immediate removal
- File size monitoring and limits
- Storage quota management per session

## Implementation Details

### File Organization Structure
```

├── {session_id}/
│   ├── original.{ext}
│   ├── markdown.md
│   ├── metadata.json
│   ├── processing.log

```

### API Endpoints

#### File Download
```http
GET /api/files/temp/{session_id}/{filename}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Range: bytes=0-1023 (optional)
```

Response:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Content-Length: 1048576
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="document.pdf"
```

#### File Listing
```http
GET /api/files/temp/{session_id}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "session_id": "abc-123-def",
  "files": [
    {
      "filename": "original.pdf",
      "size_bytes": 1048576,
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "content_type": "application/pdf"
    },
    {
      "filename": "markdown.md",
      "size_bytes": 52428,
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:31:00Z",
      "content_type": "text/markdown"
    }
  ],
  "total_size_bytes": 1100004,
  "expires_at": "2024-01-16T10:30:00Z"
}
```

#### Manual Cleanup
```http
DELETE /api/files/temp/{session_id}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

### Configuration Options
- Temporary file retention period (default: 24 hours)
- Maximum storage per session (default: 1GB)
- Supported file types for download
- Storage backend configuration (local/S3/etc.)

### Security Considerations
- Session-based access control
- File path validation to prevent directory traversal
- Content-type validation
- Rate limiting for file downloads
- Secure file deletion (overwrite before removal)

### Storage Backends

#### Local Filesystem
- Direct file storage on server filesystem
- Configurable base directory
- Automatic directory creation and cleanup

#### Cloud Storage (Future)
- S3-compatible storage support
- Signed URL generation for direct downloads
- Automatic lifecycle policies

## Error Handling
- File not found responses
- Session validation errors
- Storage quota exceeded errors
- Network interruption recovery for large downloads

## Monitoring and Logging
- File access logging
- Storage usage metrics
- Cleanup operation logging
- Performance monitoring for large file operations

## Testing Requirements
- File upload/download integration tests
- Cleanup mechanism tests
- Security tests (path traversal, unauthorized access)
- Performance tests for large file handling
- Storage quota enforcement tests

## Dependencies
- File system or cloud storage APIs
- Session management system
- Background cleanup scheduler
- Content-type detection libraries
