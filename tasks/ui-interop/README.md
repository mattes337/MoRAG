# UI Interoperability Tasks - Progress Tracking

## Overview
This folder contains tasks for implementing REST API endpoints that enable seamless integration between MoRAG and user interface applications. This README serves as the central progress tracking and orchestration document.

## Project Goals
- Provide lightweight conversion endpoints for UI preview functionality
- Implement comprehensive processing endpoints with real-time progress updates
- Enable document ID-based deduplication for better UI control
- Support webhook-based progress notifications for long-running operations

## Task Breakdown and Progress

### 01. Markdown Conversion Endpoint
**File**: `01-markdown-conversion-endpoint.md`
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
**Assignee**: TBD
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Scope**: Lightweight REST endpoint for file-to-markdown conversion
- Fast conversion without full processing pipeline
- Support for all current input formats (PDF, audio, video, text)
- Optimized for UI preview functionality
- JSON response with markdown content and metadata

**Dependencies**:
- Existing MoRAG file processors
- Docling for PDF processing
- Audio/video transcription services

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Endpoint accepts file uploads and returns markdown
- [ ] Supports all current MoRAG input formats
- [ ] Response time under 30 seconds for typical files
- [ ] Proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Unit tests with >90% coverage

### 02. Processing/Ingestion Endpoint with Webhooks
**File**: `02-processing-ingestion-endpoint.md`
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
**Assignee**: TBD
**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 days

**Scope**: Complete document processing with real-time webhook notifications
- Full MoRAG processing pipeline integration
- Webhook notifications for each processing step
- Intermediate file access via REST endpoints
- Comprehensive progress tracking

**Dependencies**:
- Task 01 (Markdown Conversion)
- Task 04 (Temporary File Management)
- Webhook delivery system
- Background task queue

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Endpoint triggers full MoRAG processing pipeline
- [ ] Webhook notifications sent for each processing step
- [ ] Reliable webhook delivery with retry logic
- [ ] Proper error handling and recovery
- [ ] Integration tests with mock webhook servers

### 03. Document ID and Deduplication System
**File**: `03-document-id-deduplication.md`
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
**Assignee**: TBD
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

**Scope**: Document ID-based deduplication system
- Accept optional document IDs from client applications
- Store document IDs in all database records
- Replace filename/checksum-based deduplication
- Support for duplicate handling strategies

**Dependencies**:
- Database schema updates
- Migration tools for existing data
- Both API endpoints (Tasks 01 & 02)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] API endpoints accept optional document_id parameter
- [ ] Document IDs stored in Neo4j and Qdrant
- [ ] Deduplication logic uses document IDs
- [ ] Migration completed for existing documents
- [ ] Comprehensive deduplication tests

---

### 04. Temporary File Management System
**File**: `04-temporary-file-management.md`
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
**Assignee**: TBD
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Scope**: Temporary file storage and access system
- REST endpoints for downloading intermediate files
- Automatic cleanup with configurable retention
- Support for streaming large files
- Secure access control

**Dependencies**:
- File storage backend (local/cloud)
- Session management system
- Background cleanup scheduler

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] File upload/download endpoints implemented
- [ ] Automatic cleanup after retention period
- [ ] Secure access with session validation
- [ ] Support for range requests and streaming
- [ ] Storage quota enforcement

---

### 05. API Documentation and Testing
**File**: `05-api-documentation.md`
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
**Assignee**: TBD
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Scope**: Comprehensive API documentation and testing framework
- OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- Interactive documentation
- Comprehensive test suite
- Performance and security testing

**Dependencies**:
- All previous tasks (01-04)
- Documentation tools
- Testing frameworks

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Complete OpenAPI specification
- [ ] Interactive Swagger UI documentation
- [ ] Unit and integration test suites
- [ ] Performance and security tests
- [ ] CI/CD integration for automated testing

## Overall Project Status

**Current Phase**: Planning and Design
**Overall Progress**: 0% Complete
**Next Milestone**: Task 01 Implementation Start
**Estimated Completion**: 2-3 weeks

## Dependencies and Blockers

### External Dependencies
- Existing MoRAG processing services (VideoService, AudioService, etc.)
- Current docling-based PDF processing
- Neo4j and Qdrant database connections
- REST API framework selection (FastAPI recommended)

### Potential Blockers
- Database schema migration complexity
- Webhook delivery infrastructure setup
- File storage backend selection and configuration
- Integration with existing MoRAG architecture

## Integration Points
- REST API framework (FastAPI/Flask)
- Existing MoRAG service architecture
- Database storage systems (Neo4j, Qdrant)
- File management and temporary storage
- Webhook delivery system
- Background task processing

## Success Criteria
- [ ] UI applications can convert files to markdown without full processing
- [ ] UI applications receive real-time updates during document processing
- [ ] Document deduplication works reliably with user-provided IDs
- [ ] All intermediate files are accessible via REST endpoints
- [ ] Comprehensive API documentation is available
- [ ] All endpoints have >90% test coverage
- [ ] Performance meets UI responsiveness requirements

## Future Considerations
- Batch processing endpoints
- WebSocket alternatives to webhooks
- Advanced file management (versioning, permanent storage)
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Multi-tenant support
- Caching strategies for improved performance
