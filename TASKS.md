## Implementation Rules
- ✅ Test-driven development (ALL tests must pass before advancing)
- ✅ Coverage requirements: >95% unit tests, >90% integration tests
- ✅ All advancement blockers must be resolved
- ✅ Use Context7 for latest library documentation
- ✅ Use package managers for dependency management

## Notes
- User prefers Gemini API for LLM operations and text-embedding-004 for embeddings
- User considers docling as alternative to unstructured.io
- User wants to add morphik and milvus technologies to the project
