# MoRAG Implementation Status

## Current Status

**Status**: ðŸš€ PRODUCTION READY  
**Last Updated**: January 2025

The MoRAG (Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation) system is production ready with comprehensive features including remote GPU workers.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Quick validation
python tests/cli/test-simple.py

# Deploy with Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Access API documentation
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Independent packages for different content types
- **Universal Document Processing**: Support for all major document formats with markdown output
- **Advanced Media Processing**: Audio/video processing with speaker diarization and topic segmentation
- **Remote GPU Workers**: User-specific remote workers with API key authentication for GPU-accelerated processing
- **Vector Storage**: Qdrant integration for similarity search with optimized chunking and deduplication
- **Production Ready**: Docker containers, monitoring, logging, and comprehensive testing
- **High Performance**: Batch embedding, optimized search, and intelligent fallback systems

## HTTP Remote Workers

MoRAG includes HTTP-based remote workers that eliminate Redis dependency:

- **No Redis required** - Direct HTTP communication with main server
- **User-specific authentication** with API keys
- **5-10x faster processing** for audio/video content
- **Simple deployment** - Just run a Python script or Docker container
- **Easy debugging** - Direct HTTP communication is easier to troubleshoot
- **Flexible scaling** - Add/remove workers without configuration
- **Complete isolation** - Each user's tasks are processed only by their workers

For setup instructions, see [HTTP Remote Workers Guide](docs/HTTP_REMOTE_WORKERS.md).

## Recent Improvements

- **Docker Optimization**: Improved build times and fixed permission issues
- **API Enhancements**: Complete ingest API with background processing and vector storage
- **Search Functionality**: Full vector similarity search implementation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fixes for processing and ingestion workflows
- **Performance**: Optimized chunking, embedding, and search operations
- **HTTP Remote Workers**: Replaced Redis/Celery workers with HTTP-based workers for simplified deployment
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed all backwards compatibility code and legacy imports for cleaner architecture
- **Redis Removal**: Completely removed Redis dependency from Docker Compose files
- **Async Processing**: Implemented proper async task queue for ingest endpoints using HTTP workers

## Core Features

- **Universal Processing**: Support for documents, audio, video, images, web pages, and YouTube content
- **Vector Storage**: Qdrant integration with optimized chunking and search
- **Background Processing**: HTTP-based task queue with remote worker support
- **API Endpoints**: Complete REST API with both processing and ingestion modes
- **Remote Workers**: User-specific GPU workers for accelerated processing
- **Docker Support**: Production-ready containerization with optimized builds

## Development

For development setup and testing:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -e packages/morag_core
pip install -e packages/morag

# Run tests
python tests/cli/test-simple.py

# Start development server
docker-compose up -d
```

See [Development Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for detailed setup instructions.
