## üìã TASK DETAILS

### Task 19: n8n Workflows and Orchestration
**File**: `tasks/19-n8n-workflows.md` (MISSING - needs creation)

**Objective**: Create n8n workflow templates and integration for orchestrating MoRAG processing pipelines.

**Requirements**:
- n8n workflow templates for common processing scenarios
- Integration with MoRAG REST API endpoints
- Webhook-based status tracking and notifications
- Error handling and retry logic in workflows
- Documentation for workflow setup and customization

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create task file with detailed specifications
2. Design workflow templates for:
   - Single document processing
   - Batch document processing
   - Web content ingestion
   - YouTube video processing
   - Multi-step processing pipelines
3. Implement webhook integrations
4. Create setup and configuration documentation
5. Test workflows with real scenarios

### Task 23: LLM Provider Abstraction
**File**: `tasks/23-llm-provider-abstraction.md` (EXISTS - needs implementation)

**Current State**: Detailed specification exists but no implementation found in codebase.

**Objective**: Create unified abstraction layer for LLM and embedding providers with fallback mechanisms.

**Missing Implementation**:
- Abstract provider interfaces (LLMProvider, EmbeddingProvider)
- Provider implementations (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Provider manager with fallback logic
- Configuration system for provider selection
- Circuit breaker and retry mechanisms

**Integration Points**:
- Replace direct Gemini calls in `src/morag/services/`
- Update embedding generation in vector storage
- Modify summarization services
- Update all AI service calls to use abstraction

### Task 36: Complete Cleanup and Migration
**File**: `tasks/36-cleanup-and-migration.md` (PARTIALLY COMPLETE)

**Issues Found**:
1. **Legacy Code in src/morag**:
   - `src/morag/processors/` - Contains audio.py, image.py, video.py that should be package-only
   - `src/morag/converters/` - Has converters not fully migrated to packages
   - `src/morag/services/` - Contains services that should be in morag-services package

2. **Import Path Inconsistencies**:
   - Examples still use `from morag.processors.audio import AudioProcessor`
   - Should use `from morag_audio import AudioProcessor`
   - Mixed usage throughout codebase

3. **Duplicate Functionality**:
   - Same classes exist in both src/morag and packages/
   - Potential for import conflicts and confusion

**Required Actions**:
1. Remove obsolete implementations from src/morag
2. Update all import paths to use modular packages
3. Ensure examples and scripts use new import paths
4. Test backward compatibility
5. Update documentation

### Task 37: Repository Structure Optimization
**File**: `tasks/37-repository-structure-optimization.md` (NEW - needs creation)

**Objective**: Optimize repository structure and consolidate scattered components.

**Issues to Address**:
1. **Inconsistent Architecture**:
   - Both monolithic (src/morag) and modular (packages/) structures exist
   - Unclear which should be used for new development
   - Documentation doesn't clearly specify the preferred approach

2. **Testing Gaps**:
   - Missing integration tests for modular architecture
   - No tests validating package separation works correctly
   - Legacy tests may still reference old import paths

3. **Documentation Inconsistencies**:
   - README files in different packages have different formats
   - Installation instructions vary between packages
   - Missing unified development guide

**Deliverables**:
1. Unified repository structure documentation
2. Integration test suite for modular components
3. Consistent package documentation
4. Updated development and deployment guides
5. Migration guide for users transitioning from monolithic to modular

## üéØ NEXT ACTIONS

### Immediate Priority (This Week)
1. **Create Task 19 specification** - n8n workflows and orchestration
2. **Implement Task 23** - LLM provider abstraction (high impact)
3. **Complete Task 36** - Clean up src/morag legacy code

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)  
1. **Create Task 37 specification** - Repository structure optimization
2. **Implement integration tests** for modular architecture
3. **Update all documentation** to reflect modular structure

### Quality Assurance
- All tasks must have comprehensive tests before marking as complete
- Integration tests required for modular architecture validation
- Documentation must be updated to reflect actual implementation state
- Backward compatibility must be maintained during transitions

## üìä PROGRESS TRACKING

### Task Status Legend
- **NOT_STARTED**: Task identified but no work begun
- **DOCUMENTED_NOT_IMPLEMENTED**: Specification exists but no code implementation
- **PARTIALLY_COMPLETE**: Some implementation exists but significant work remains
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Active development underway
- **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues
- **TESTING**: Implementation complete, testing in progress
- **COMPLETE**: Fully implemented, tested, and documented

### Current Sprint Focus
**Sprint Goal**: Complete modular architecture migration and establish provider abstraction

**Sprint Tasks**:
1. Task 19 (n8n workflows) - NOT_STARTED ‚Üí DOCUMENTED_NOT_IMPLEMENTED

3. Task 36 (cleanup) - PARTIALLY_COMPLETE ‚Üí COMPLETE
4. Task 37 (optimization) - NOT_STARTED ‚Üí DOCUMENTED_NOT_IMPLEMENTED

## üìù NOTES

### Architecture Decision Records
- **Modular Architecture**: Adopted package-based modular architecture for better scalability and maintainability
- **Provider Abstraction**: Required for multi-LLM support and vendor independence
- **Legacy Code**: src/morag to be maintained only for backward compatibility during transition

### Technical Debt
- Legacy import paths throughout codebase
- Duplicate functionality between monolithic and modular structures  
- Inconsistent documentation across packages
- Missing integration tests for modular components

### Dependencies
- Task 19 depends on Tasks 17-18 (API and status tracking)
- Task 23 depends on Task 14 (current Gemini integration)
- Task 37 depends on Task 36 (cleanup completion)

### Task 38: Fix File Upload API Endpoint - HIGH PRIORITY
**File**: `tasks/38-fix-file-upload-api.md` (CREATED)
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS

**Objective**: Fix file upload handling in the /process/file API endpoint.

**Issue**: API returns "No such file or directory" errors when processing uploaded files, suggesting files are not being saved to the expected temporary directory properly.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. Hardcoded `/tmp/` path doesn't exist on Windows systems
2. No proper temporary directory handling with platform-specific paths
3. Missing file validation and security checks
4. No proper cleanup on processing failures

**Implementation Progress**:
- ‚úÖ Identified file upload API issues in server.py
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive task specification
- ‚úÖ Implemented cross-platform temporary file handling
- ‚úÖ Added file validation and security measures
- ‚úÖ Fixed ContentType enum issues
- ‚úÖ Fixed Path object string conversion issues
- üîÑ Fixing ProcessingConfig parameter issues
- üîÑ Fixing ProcessingResult attribute mapping
- ‚è≥ Creating comprehensive file upload tests

**Deliverables**:
- ‚úÖ Working file upload API endpoint with cross-platform support
- ‚úÖ Proper temporary file handling with cleanup
- ‚úÖ File validation and security measures
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive file upload tests

### Task 39: MoRAG System Testing and Validation - IN_PROGRESS
**File**: `tasks/39-system-testing-validation.md` (CREATED)
