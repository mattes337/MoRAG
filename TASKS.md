## Current Focus
âœ… Task 01: Project Setup and Configuration - COMPLETED
âœ… Task 02: FastAPI Service Setup with Async Support - COMPLETED
âœ… Task 03: Qdrant Vector Database Configuration - COMPLETED
âœ… Task 04: Async Task Processing with Celery/Redis - COMPLETED
âœ… Task 05: Document Parser with unstructured.io/docling - COMPLETED
âœ… Task 06: Semantic Chunking with spaCy - COMPLETED
ðŸ”„ Task 07: Summary Generation with Gemini - READY TO START

## Implementation Rules
- âœ… Test-driven development (ALL tests must pass before advancing)
- âœ… Coverage requirements: >95% unit tests, >90% integration tests
- âœ… All advancement blockers must be resolved
- âœ… Use Context7 for latest library documentation
- âœ… Use package managers for dependency management

## Notes
- User prefers Gemini API for LLM operations and text-embedding-004 for embeddings
- User considers docling as alternative to unstructured.io
- User wants to add morphik and milvus technologies to the project
