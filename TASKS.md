## Bug Fixes Completed

### Audio/Video Transcription Critical Bugs Fix
- **Issue**: Topic timestamps always showing as 0 instead of actual timestamps in seconds format [123]
- **Root Cause**: Topic segmentation service's `_calculate_topic_timing` method was failing to properly match sentences with transcript segments, causing `start_time` and `end_time` to be `None`, which defaulted to `0` in converters
- **Solution**: Enhanced timestamp calculation with improved text matching, better fallback mechanisms, and extensive debugging logging
- **Issue**: Text repetition bug causing infinite loops at the end of transcriptions
- **Root Cause**: Lack of deduplication in dialogue creation and potential repetitive patterns in final output
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive text deduplication safeguards and repetitive pattern removal
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/morag/services/topic_segmentation.py` (enhanced `_calculate_topic_timing` and `_simple_text_match` methods)
  - `src/morag/converters/audio.py` (added text deduplication and `_remove_repetitive_patterns` method)
  - `src/morag/converters/video.py` (added improved timestamp handling and text deduplication)
  - `scripts/debug_transcription_issues.py` (comprehensive debugging script)
  - `scripts/check_dependencies.py` (dependency checking script)
  - `tests/manual/test_transcription_fixes.py` (validation test suite)
  - `scripts/generate_test_audio.py` (test audio file generator)
- **Features Added**:
  - **Enhanced Timestamp Calculation**: Improved text matching algorithm with multiple fallback strategies
  - **Better Text Matching**: More lenient text similarity detection with substring and word-based matching
  - **Text Deduplication**: Comprehensive safeguards against duplicate text entries in dialogue creation
  - **Repetitive Pattern Removal**: Final content cleaning to remove consecutive repeated lines and end-of-content repetition
  - **Extensive Debugging**: Detailed logging throughout the timestamp calculation process
  - **Improved Fallback Mechanisms**: Better proportional mapping when direct text matching fails
  - **Dependency Checking**: Script to identify missing optional dependencies and their impact
  - **Comprehensive Testing**: Validation suite to verify timestamp accuracy and repetition prevention
- **Quality Improvements**:
  - Topic timestamps now correctly show actual start times in seconds format [123] instead of always [0]
  - Text repetition at the end of transcripts eliminated through multiple safeguard layers
  - Better handling of edge cases where timing information is unavailable
  - Enhanced error handling and logging for debugging timestamp calculation issues
  - Improved text similarity matching with reduced threshold (25% vs 30%) for better matching
  - Added substring matching for more accurate sentence-to-segment alignment

### Audio Processing Error Fix
- **Issue**: `'AudioProcessor' object has no attribute 'process_audio'`
- **Root Cause**: Audio converter was calling incorrect method name
- **Solution**: Updated `src/morag/converters/audio.py` line 106 to call `process_audio_file` instead of `process_audio`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/morag/converters/audio.py`
  - `tests/unit/test_audio_converter_fix.py` (new test file)

### PDF Text Encoding Fix
- **Issue**: PDF text showing garbled characters like "extrem  ange­ schlagen" instead of "angeschlagen"
- **Root Cause**: Soft hyphens and other Unicode encoding artifacts not properly handled
- **Solution**: Enhanced text processing with comprehensive Unicode normalization and soft hyphen handling
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/morag/utils/text_processing.py` (added `clean_pdf_text_encoding` and `normalize_text_encoding` functions)
  - `src/morag/converters/pdf.py` (integrated encoding fixes)
  - `src/morag/processors/document.py` (integrated encoding fixes)
  - `tests/unit/test_pdf_encoding_fix.py` (new test file)

### Audio Segment Naming Conflict Fix
- **Issue**: `type object 'AudioSegment' has no attribute 'from_file'` error during audio conversion
- **Root Cause**: Custom `AudioSegment` dataclass was shadowing the pydub `AudioSegment` class import
- **Solution**: Renamed custom dataclass to `AudioTranscriptSegment` and imported pydub as `PydubAudioSegment`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/morag/processors/audio.py` (renamed dataclass and fixed import)
  - `src/morag/services/whisper_service.py` (updated import and usage)

### Video Audio Extraction Optimization
- **Issue**: Video audio extraction was creating 580MB audio files from 100MB video files due to uncompressed WAV format
- **Root Cause**: Default audio format was WAV with PCM encoding, which is uncompressed and creates files 5-20x larger than source
- **Solution**: Optimized audio extraction for minimal processing time and file size overhead

  - Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting codec selection
  - Warning messages when using uncompressed formats like WAV
- **Performance Improvements**:
  - MP3 -> MP3: Stream copy (seconds, same file size as source)
  - AAC -> AAC: Stream copy (seconds, same file size as source)
  - AAC -> MP3: Fast encoding (seconds to minutes, small compressed file)
  - Any -> WAV: Uncompressed extraction (minutes, 5-20x larger files)
  - Processing time reduced by 80-95% for compatible formats
  - File sizes reduced by 80-95% compared to WAV extraction

### Video FFmpeg Error Handling Fix
- **Issue**: Video audio extraction failing with "ffmpeg error (see stderr output for detail)" but no actual stderr output visible
- **Root Cause**: FFmpeg calls were using `quiet=True` which suppressed stderr output, and None bitrate parameters were being passed to ffmpeg
- **Solution**: Enhanced error handling to capture stderr output and fixed parameter handling to exclude None values
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/morag/processors/video.py` (improved error handling and parameter filtering)
- **Features Added**:
  - Proper stderr capture in ffmpeg error handling with `quiet=False` and `capture_stderr=True`
  - Parameter filtering to exclude None values from being passed to ffmpeg
  - Detailed error messages showing actual ffmpeg stderr output for debugging

- **Solution**: Updated PDF converter to use correct docling v2 API with `result.document.iterate_items()` method
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/morag/converters/pdf.py` (completely refactored to use docling v2 API structure)
  - `tests/test_docling_pdf_fix.py` (added test to verify elements attribute fix works correctly)
- **API Changes**:
  - **Before**: `for page_num, page in enumerate(docling_result.document.pages, 1): for element in page.elements:`
  - **After**: `for item, level in docling_result.document.iterate_items(): if hasattr(item, 'text') and item.text.strip():`
- **Features Fixed**:
  - PDF converter advanced docling processing no longer fails with elements attribute error
  - Proper page-based content organization using docling v2 provenance information
