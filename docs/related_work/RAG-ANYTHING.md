## LLM Prompting System Analysis

### Entity Extraction Prompts
RAG-Anything leverages LightRAG's entity extraction system with multimodal enhancements:

**Core Entity Extraction Approach:**
- Uses LLM-based entity extraction with graph-aware prompting
- Focuses on named entities, concepts, and cross-modal references
- Implements few-shot learning with domain-specific examples
- Maintains entity consistency across different modalities

**Multimodal Entity Processing:**
- **Visual Content**: Extracts entities from image captions and visual descriptions
- **Tabular Data**: Identifies entities within structured data and table headers
- **Mathematical Content**: Extracts mathematical concepts and formula components
- **Cross-Modal Linking**: Creates unified entity representations across modalities

### Relationship Extraction Prompts
**Graph Construction Strategy:**
- Implements relationship extraction between entities within and across modalities
- Uses semantic similarity and contextual proximity for relationship scoring
- Maintains hierarchical "belongs_to" relationships for document structure
- Applies weighted scoring based on relationship type and confidence

**Cross-Modal Relationship Types:**
- **Spatial Relationships**: Between visual elements and textual descriptions
- **Semantic Relationships**: Between concepts across different content types
- **Hierarchical Relationships**: Document structure and content organization
- **Reference Relationships**: Citations, figure references, and cross-references

### Retrieval and Query Prompts
**Hybrid Retrieval Strategy:**
- Combines vector similarity search with graph traversal
- Uses modality-aware ranking for result prioritization
- Implements contextual coherence maintenance across retrieved elements
- Applies adaptive scoring based on query type and content modality

## Extraction Methods

### Multi-Modal Entity Extraction
- **Entity Identification**: Transforms significant multimodal elements into structured knowledge graph entities
- **Semantic Annotations**: Adds contextual metadata and relationship information to extracted entities
- **Cross-Modal Consistency**: Ensures entity normalization and deduplication across different content types
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Maintains document structure through entity relationships

### Cross-Modal Relationship Mapping
- **Automated Inference**: Uses LLM-based relationship detection between textual and multimodal components
- **Semantic Proximity**: Calculates relationship strength based on contextual significance
- **Structural Preservation**: Maintains original document organization through "belongs_to" relationship chains
- **Weighted Scoring**: Assigns quantitative relevance scores to different relationship types

### Knowledge Graph Construction
- **Unified Representation**: Creates single knowledge graph spanning all content modalities
- **Relationship Types**: Implements semantic, spatial, hierarchical, and reference relationships
- **Graph Traversal**: Enables efficient navigation through multimodal content relationships
- **Query Integration**: Supports both vector and graph-based retrieval strategies

## Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Multimodal Support**: Handles diverse content types natively with unified processing
2. **Specialized Processing**: Modality-specific analysis and extraction with cross-modal integration
3. **Cross-Modal Integration**: Unified representation across content types with semantic relationships
4. **Adaptive Processing**: Flexible parsing and content routing with multiple processing modes

- **No Temporal Modeling**: Lacks explicit temporal relationship handling and fact evolution tracking
- **Complex Setup**: Requires multiple specialized components and dependencies (MinerU, vision models, etc.)
- **Processing Overhead**: Multimodal processing can be computationally expensive with GPU requirements
- **Entity-Centric Design**: Less suitable for applications requiring detailed fact extraction and validation
- **Limited Reasoning**: Primarily focused on retrieval rather than complex reasoning over extracted knowledge

## Detailed Prompt Comparison with MoRAG

### Entity Extraction Prompts

**RAG-Anything Approach:**
```
Extract entities from multimodal content focusing on:
- Named entities (people, organizations, locations)
- Technical concepts and terminology
- Cross-modal references (figure mentions, table references)
- Mathematical concepts and variables
- Visual elements and their descriptions

For each entity, provide:
- Entity name and type
- Modality source (text, image, table, equation)
- Contextual relationships
- Confidence score
```

**MoRAG Approach:**
```python
# From MoRAG's entity extraction prompts
"Extract entities from the text in order of appearance.
Focus on important entities like people, organizations, locations, concepts, and objects.
Use exact text for extractions. Do not paraphrase or overlap entities.
Provide meaningful attributes for each entity to add context."
```

**Key Differences:**
- RAG-Anything: Multimodal entity extraction with cross-modal linking
- MoRAG: Text-focused with entity normalization and LLM-based canonicalization
- RAG-Anything: Emphasizes visual and structural elements
- MoRAG: Focuses on domain-specific technical terms and fact-related entities

### Relationship Extraction Prompts

**RAG-Anything Approach:**
- Focuses on spatial, semantic, and hierarchical relationships
- Emphasizes cross-modal connections (text-to-image, table-to-text)
- Uses weighted scoring for relationship importance
- Maintains document structure through "belongs_to" chains

**MoRAG Approach:**
```python
# From MoRAG's relationship extraction
"Identify relationships like:
- SUPPORTS: One fact provides evidence for another
- ELABORATES: One fact provides more detail about another
- CONTRADICTS: Facts that present conflicting information
- SEQUENCE: Facts that represent steps in a process
- COMPARISON: Facts that compare different approaches/solutions
- CAUSATION: One fact describes the cause of another
- TEMPORAL_ORDER: Facts that have a time-based sequence"
```

**Key Differences:**
- RAG-Anything: Structure and content-focused relationships
- MoRAG: Fact-centric relationships with semantic meaning
- RAG-Anything: Cross-modal relationship mapping
- MoRAG: Fact validation and reasoning-oriented relationships

### Knowledge Representation Differences

**RAG-Anything:**
