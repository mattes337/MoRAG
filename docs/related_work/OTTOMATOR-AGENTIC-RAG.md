https://github.com/coleam00/ottomator-agents/tree/main/agentic-rag-knowledge-graph

## Overview

Ottomator Agentic RAG (coleam00) is an agent-based hybrid search system with temporal knowledge graphs, designed for intelligent combination of vector search and knowledge graph queries.

## Architecture Strengths

- **Hybrid Search Strategy**: Intelligent combination of vector search and knowledge graph queries
- **Temporal Knowledge Graphs**: Graphiti integration for time-aware relationship tracking
- **Agent-Based Decision Making**: Pydantic AI agent automatically selects optimal search strategies
- **Production-Ready Design**: Comprehensive testing, error handling, and monitoring
- **Flexible LLM Support**: Multiple provider support (OpenAI, Ollama, OpenRouter, Gemini)

## Key Technical Features

- **Semantic Chunking**: LLM-powered intelligent document splitting
- **PostgreSQL + pgvector**: High-performance vector storage with SQL capabilities
- **Neo4j + Graphiti**: Temporal relationship tracking with graph database
- **Streaming API**: Real-time responses with Server-Sent Events
- **Tool Selection Intelligence**: Agent decides when to use vector vs graph search

## Extraction Methods

- **Entity and Relationship Extraction**: Automated extraction during ingestion
- **Temporal Fact Tracking**: Changes in facts and relationships over time
- **Semantic Similarity**: Vector-based content retrieval
- **Graph Traversal**: Relationship-based discovery and analysis

## Strengths

1. **Temporal Intelligence**: Tracks how information evolves over time
2. **Agent Autonomy**: Intelligent tool selection without manual configuration
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Best of both vector and graph search
4. **Production Focus**: Built for real-world deployment
5. **Flexible Architecture**: Multiple LLM and database provider support

## Weaknesses

- **Limited Multimodal Support**: Primarily text-focused processing
- **Complex Infrastructure**: Requires PostgreSQL, Neo4j, and Graphiti setup
- **Agent Overhead**: Additional complexity from agent decision-making layer
- **Domain Specific**: Optimized for tech company/AI initiative analysis

## Key Innovations for MoRAG

### High Priority Adoptions

1. **Temporal Knowledge Graphs**: Implement time-aware relationship tracking
2. **Agent-Based Tool Selection**: Add intelligent search strategy selection
3. **Hybrid Search Architecture**: Seamless vector and graph integration
4. **Production-Ready Design**: Comprehensive testing and monitoring

### Technical Implementation Considerations

- **Graphiti Integration**: Consider adopting for temporal relationship tracking
- **Agent Framework**: Implement Pydantic AI or similar for intelligent decision making
- **Streaming Responses**: Add real-time response generation capabilities
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Extend LLM and embedding provider options

## Comparison with MoRAG

| Aspect | Ottomator | MoRAG |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Search Types** | Hybrid (vector + graph) | Recursive fact traversal |
| **Intelligence** | Agent-based tool selection | LLM-guided traversal |
| **Temporal Awareness** | Graphiti temporal tracking | None |
| **Storage** | PostgreSQL + Neo4j | Neo4j + Qdrant |
| **Focus** | Entity relationships | Structured facts |

## Recommended Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Temporal Intelligence (3-4 weeks)
1. Add temporal fields to fact and relationship models
2. Implement fact evolution tracking
3. Add time-aware retrieval capabilities

### Phase 2: Agent-Based Intelligence (4-5 weeks)
1. Implement query intent analysis
2. Add intelligent tool selection logic
3. Create adaptive search strategies

### Phase 3: Production Enhancements (3-4 weeks)
1. Comprehensive testing framework
2. Monitoring and observability
3. Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Hybrid Search Integration (2-3 weeks)
1. Implement seamless vector and graph search combination
2. Add streaming response capabilities
3. Enhance multi-provider support

## Temporal Knowledge Graph Benefits

- **Fact Evolution**: Track how facts change over time
- **Relationship Dynamics**: Monitor changing relationships between entities
- **Historical Context**: Provide temporal context for retrieved information
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns and trends in knowledge evolution

This would significantly enhance MoRAG's intelligence and production readiness while adding crucial temporal awareness capabilities.
