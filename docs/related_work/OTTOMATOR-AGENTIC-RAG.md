"""
Analyze the user query and determine the optimal search strategy:

Query: {user_query}

Consider:
1. Information type needed (factual, relational, temporal, analytical)
2. Query complexity (simple lookup vs complex reasoning)

4. Relationship depth (direct facts vs connected knowledge)

Available tools:
- Vector Search: Best for semantic similarity and content retrieval
- Graph Search: Best for relationship exploration and connected knowledge
- Hybrid Search: Best for complex queries requiring both approaches
